FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

ABSTRACT
If Earth were keeping a diary, the last century would be inked in black with the title: “The
Plastic Age.” From microscopic particles infiltrating cells of living organisms to colossal garbage
patches drifting in the oceans, plastics have become etched into the planet’s geological record.
But at what cost?
Every year, the world generates more than 400 million tons of plastic waste, with an estimated
11 million tons entering the world’s oceans. To date, over 200 million tons have accumulated in
marine environments. Surface water samples reveal that plastics now outweigh zooplankton
by a factor of six. If current trends continue, by 2050 the mass of plastics in the oceans will
surpass the mass of all fish.
Although plastics take hundreds or even thousands of years to degrade, they break down
under the influence of waves, salt water, and ultraviolet radiation into tiny fragments known
as micro- and nanoplastics. These particles can travel thousands of miles through marine air
and precipitation, crossing borders, continents, and oceans. They accumulate in forests and
are found in our food and drinking water. Microplastics have been detected in some of the
most remote locations on Earth, from the Mariana Trench to the summit of Mount Everest.
This report presents a comprehensive analytical assessment of the impact of plastic
pollution on the environment, human health, and the resilience of society’s critical systems. It
examines the behavior of micro- and nanoplastics that carry static charges and toxic chemical
compounds, and their effects on ecosystems. Particular attention is given to their role in ocean
acidification, destabilization of food chains, and threats to biodiversity. The report suggests
a hypothesis linking micro- and nanoplastics to changes in water properties, which may
accelerate ocean warming and intensify natural disasters.
One of the most urgent and troubling issues discussed in this report is the impact of
micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) on human health. Due to their minute size, these particles can
bypass biological barriers, triggering oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammatory responses,
and cellular dysfunction. The report highlights a possible correlation between MNP exposure
and the rising prevalence of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. It shows that
exposure to MNPs during prenatal and postnatal development can impair cognitive function
and mental health in children, posing a serious threat to future generations.

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

The growing incidence of MNP-related diseases is already diminishing the quality of
life, particularly in regions with high levels of plastic pollution. The report identifies regions
currently facing heightened risk as well as those that so far remain relatively unaffected. If
the situation continues to deteriorate and effective protective measures remain unavailable,
populations may be forced to migrate in search of safer living conditions. This can lead to
waves of uncontrolled migration, heightening social tension, straining urban infrastructure,
and destabilizing economies.
In this way, the environmental challenge of plastic pollution will gradually evolve into a
macroeconomic and geopolitical challenge.
The report underscores the urgent need to address MNP pollution, offering a new perspective
on distribution, impact, and effects of MNPs. The report is unique as it is based on an
interdisciplinary approach that integrates physical, chemical, and biological data on plastic
pollution. This makes the report relevant to scientists across a broad range of fields, who are
committed to developing sustainable solutions for a safer future for the planet and humanity.

CONSEQUENCES OF PLASTIC POLLUTION:
MICRO- AND NANOPLASTICS (MNPS) AS
A NEW DRIVER OF THE PLANETARY CRISIS
Plastics have become an inseparable part of present-day life. Packaging and utensils, clothing and
footwear, hygiene products and medicine, transportation and communication — most everyday items
are made of plastics. However, plastics do not just exist in the form of large visible objects: they also
break down into microscopic particles known as microplastics and nanoplastics. Microplastics are
defined as particles smaller than 5 mm, often visible to the naked eye. Nanoplastics, on the other hand,
measure less than one micrometer (one-millionth of a meter), and most of them are invisible even under
a standard microscope.
Plastic materials come in a variety of types, but all are composed of polymers — natural or synthetic
substances built from long molecular chains. Polymers possess unique chemical properties that make
them highly durable and resistant to degradation in the environment.
Thus, thanks to their durability, versatility, and low production cost, plastics have become a major
material of choice for mass manufacturing, especially for single-use items.¹ However, improper waste
management has turned plastics into the world’s most voluminous pollutants by mass.

Quantitative Estimates
and Trends in Global Plastic Waste Production
Since the 1950s, the world has produced approximately 9,200 million metric tons of plastics. Of that,
about 2,900 million tons are still in use today, including 2,700 million tons of virgin plastics and roughly
200 million tons of recycled materials. Around 5,300 million tons have ended up in landfills, while 1,000
million tons have been incinerated. An additional 1,750 to 2,500 million tons are classified as “mismanaged,”
meaning they may have entered the environment through uncontrolled channels (Fig. 1).
To date, nearly 640 million tons of chemical additives have been incorporated into plastic products.2
According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),3 the world now produces more
than 400 million tons of plastic waste annually.

Currently, over 200 million tons of big plastic waste (macroplastics) and approximately 35,540 tons
of microplastics have accumulated in the oceans.6 Estimates of annual plastic waste entering aquatic
ecosystems from land sources vary depending on analytical methods. Under a “business-as-usual”
(BAU) scenario without intervention, these levels can nearly triple — from 9–14 million tons in 2016 to
23–37 million tons a year by 2040.
Another methodology projects an almost doubling of ocean-bound plastic waste — from 19–23 million
tons in 2016 to 53 million tons by 2030.7
As indicated by research, if current trends persist, by 2050 the ocean will hold as much as 12,000
million tons of plastics,8 rivaling the total biomass of marine fish estimated at roughly 10,000 million tons.9
Depending on the type, plastics take between 100 and 1,000 years to decompose (Fig. 3).
In marine environments, especially in the cold and dark depths of the ocean, plastics break down even
more slowly.10

Except for the portion that has been incinerated, virtually all plastics ever introduced into the environment
still exist today either as intact objects or in fragmented form.11 This waste doesn’t disappear and keeps
accumulating. The situation is akin to a trash bin that is constantly being filled but never emptied. The
question of what that bin might look like after a month indicates the scale of the problem of global plastic
waste accumulation.

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch
Plastic waste accumulated in the ocean water and floating on its surface is captured by ocean currents
and carried into central gyres, forming massive clusters known as “garbage patches.”

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest concentration of plastics on the planet, and it exhibits
steady growth (Fig. 4). The garbage patch spans a vast area between North America and Japan.
Observations indicate that in 2018, its surface area measured about 618 thousand square miles,12 although
this figure is subject to fluctuation due to ocean currents and seasonal variability.
Studies indicate that up to 80 %13 of the material in the garbage patches consists of plastics.14 The
patch contains at least 80,000 metric tons of plastic waste.15 Yet, that’s just the visible portion of the
problem. An estimated 94 % of ocean plastic sinks to the seabed16 where vast amounts of waste may
remain hidden and continue to accumulate.
The full extent of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is still unknown, partly because the North Pacific
Subtropical Gyre is so vast that it defies comprehensive scientific mapping with current technology.

Dynamics of Plastics Accumulation in the Ocean
Instrument-based measurements show an exponential increase in the size of the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch. Between 2015 and 2022, the average mass of plastic waste in this region grew fivefold.17 Of
particular concern is the tenfold increase in small plastic fragments over the same period, evidencing
rapid degradation of larger plastic debris.
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch has effectively formed a seventh “continent” on Earth. However, it
is important to note that this phenomenon is not unique. To date, scientists have identified five major
garbage patches in the world’s oceans18: two in the Atlantic, two in the Pacific, and one in the Indian
Ocean19 (Fig. 5).

Figure 5: Schematic representation of the five major garbage patches in the world’s
oceans: two in the Atlantic, two in the Pacific, and one in the Indian Ocean.
Millions of tons of plastics and other human-generated waste are circulating in
the oceans. These garbage patches are growing at an alarming rate.

How Micro- and Nanoplastic Particles Are Formed
Plastic waste is highly resistant to biodegradation, however, under the influence of waves, saltwater, and
sunlight, it gradually breaks down into smaller particles — micro- and nanoplastics20 that are often invisible
to the naked eye. These particles retain their polymer structure,21 and the degradation process continues
down to the nanoscale (Figs. 6–7). As a result, having bypassed natural degradation mechanisms, plastic
waste becomes a permanent component of the planet’s ecosystems.
Moreover, micro- and nanoplastics contain hazardous chemicals that are added during plastic
manufacturing.
"We now know that plastics contain roughly 16,000 chemicals. Of these, it is known that over 4,200 are
persistent in the environment, accumulate in living organisms, are transported over long distances or pose
a potential hazard," says Annika Jahnke, author and environmental chemist at the Helmholtz Centre for
Environmental Research (UFZ).22

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Spread of Micro- and Nanoplastics in the Ocean
The highest concentrations of plastics are found in the regions of garbage patches. Those oceanic
dumps function like industrial plants where micro- and nanoplastics are continuously generated. Much like
a virus spreads through the body via the bloodstream, microplastics are transported by ocean currents
throughout the world’s oceans, underscoring the global scale of the issue.
Despite technical challenges in detecting microplastics, which complicate their accurate quantification
in the oceans, theoretical models make it possible to estimate the magnitude of the problem.
Microplastics are found in nearly every sample of ocean water, while in some regions, concentrations
are dozens of times higher than the global average.
Oceanic gyres contribute to the widespread distribution of microplastics, reaching even remote regions
such as the Arctic. Studies of ice cores have shown that microplastic pollution levels in the Arctic Ocean
are 100 times higher than those in the waters north of Scotland or the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.23
These findings point to both the severity and transboundary nature of the problem.
Most global studies on plastic pollution in marine environments focus on the ocean’s surface layer.
According to estimates, in 2019 the surface layer of the ocean contained between 82 and 358 trillion
plastic particles.24
However, there is mounting evidence that in deep-sea zones and bottom sediments, the number of
microplastic particles may reach uncountable trillions.25
Lightweight plastics tend to float, while denser plastics or those colonized by marine organisms sink
to the ocean floor.26 Estimates suggest that about 50% of urban plastic waste is denser than seawater,
allowing it to settle quickly. Once on the seafloor, it is transported by deep-sea currents and accumulates
in trenches and depressions. Microplastics have even been found at the bottom of the Mariana Trench
— the deepest known point in the ocean (Figs. 8–9).27

In fact, the primary site of microplastics accumulation is not the ocean surface, but the deep-sea
floor. Gradually, the entire ocean floor is becoming covered with a layer of plastics. However, data on
microplastic pollution in the ocean is likely underestimated, and the actual situation may be significantly
worse. “Not everyone has access to very sophisticated and expensive instruments and sampling tools,”
explains Melanie Bergmann, a biologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. She says that as
much as 80-90% of marine microplastic particles may be missed by standard sampling techniques
because they are too small to be detected (Fig. 10).28

In addition to surface and bottom layer pollution (Fig. 11), the concentrations of micro- and nanoplastics
increase significantly in the thermocline zone29 (Fig. 12) — a layer of water characterized by a sharp
temperature change. The steep density gradient in this layer causes plastic particles to become trapped
for extended periods. The ocean can be visualized as a layered cake, where each layer has a unique
temperature and density, and microplastics accumulate at the boundaries between those layers.
Furthermore, microplastics are dispersed throughout the ocean via living organisms that ingest,
digest, and excrete them.30

When water evaporates,31 microplastics rise into the atmosphere from the surface of the ocean.32
Additionally, a combination of sea spray, wind, and waves creates air bubbles in the water that contain
microplastics. When the bubbles burst, the particles are released into the atmosphere (Fig. 13). Each
year, around 136,000 tons of microplastic33 is transported to coastal areas by sea breezes alone. Up to
25 million metric tons of micro- and nanoplastic is transported annually for thousands of kilometers by
marine air, spray, snow, and fog, crossing countries, continents, and oceans.
“Air is a much more dynamic medium than water,” says co-author Dr. Melanie Bergmann
from AWI. “As a result, micro- and nanoplastics can reach the most remote and so far
largely untouched regions of our planet much more quickly.”
Once there, the particles may affect surface climate and the health of local ecosystems.34
Microplastics have been found in various places — from the sea surface to deep-sea sediments,
from agricultural lands to our highest mountains, as well as in sea ice, lakes, and rivers. They have been
detected in 1,300 aquatic and terrestrial species, from invertebrates at the base of the food chain to
top predators, with evidence of impact at all levels of biological organization, from the cellular to the
ecosystem level. Microplastics are widespread in the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe
(Fig. 14). They have been found in many human tissues and organs, and evidence of their potential effect
is beginning to emerge.35

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Thus, the transport of microplastics to remote and even polar regions may be due to a combination
of atmospheric and marine pathways.
Therefore, it is important to understand the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean in
order to determine which particle sizes are being transported and in what quantities.
For example, a group of researchers recently discovered plastic granules with hydrophilic
(water-attracting) surfaces36 in clouds atop mountains in Japan.
They then analyzed the samples and concluded that lower-altitude and denser clouds contain higher
amounts of microplastics.
The presence of polymers, acting as condensation nuclei, plays a key role in rapid cloud formation,
which may ultimately influence the overall climate.36
Plastic particles in clouds help retain more water, delaying rainfall. When rain finally occurs, it becomes
more intense, as more water has accumulated in the clouds.
In addition, microplastics that had been exposed to ultraviolet light and filtered water from clouds
have a rougher surface, which promotes the accumulation of more lead, mercury, and oxygen-containing
groups37 on their surface.
The atmosphere primarily transports small microplastic particles, making it a much faster transport
pathway that can result in significant deposition across a wide range of ecosystems.
Research data shows that forests act as barriers to windborne microplastics. Leaves, branches, and
trunks trap microplastic particles, which settle on their surfaces. This causes microplastic particles
carried by wind and precipitation to remain on the plants or settle on the ground.
Limited airflow beneath the dense forest canopy promotes the sustained accumulation of these particles
within forested areas. The canopy leaves serve as a long-term reservoir for airborne microplastics.38
Studies have shown that from autumn 2017 to summer 2019, more than 1,000 tons of plastic particles
fell with precipitation across 11 national parks and reserves in the western United States. This amount
is enough to produce 120 million plastic bottles.39
A similar situation is observed in other regions of the world. For example, *Quercus serrata* forests
in Japan, covering an area of about 32,500 km², annually capture approximately 420 trillion airborne
microplastic particles40 in their canopies.

Unlike forests, in the cities there is better deposition of micro- and nanoplastics because of better
ventilation and the presence of heavier particulates from vehicle exhaust and industrial smog. Today,
the air in forests is more saturated with nanoplastic than in megacities.
The world has changed! Now, when people swim in the ocean, sunbathe on the beach, jog along
the coast or in the park, or walk in the forest for their health, they are, in fact, exposing their bodies to
additional microplastic contamination.
Microplastics from Africa and North America have been found in remote and seemingly untouched
places, such as the French Pyrenees. This indicates the global distribution of microplastic, which is
carried by air currents and precipitation across vast distances.
Micro- and nanoplastics enter urban water bodies through stormwater runoff, industrial discharge,
and rainwater, which captures particles from the atmosphere. For example, a single wash of synthetic
fabrics can release up to 1.5 million microplastic41 particles into wastewater. Once in the, these particles
eventually flow into rivers and oceans, where they are ingested by fish and other aquatic organisms.
By analyzing waste found in rivers and surrounding landscapes, researchers estimated that just 10
river systems transport between 88% and 95% of the plastic that flows from rivers into the ocean.42
In another study, scientists reassessed commonly accepted assumptions about plastic transport in
rivers and concluded that the actual amount of plastic waste in rivers could be 90% higher than previously
thought.43
Plastic is also present in most of the world's large lakes. In fact, the density of plastic waste in lakes
may even exceed that in the largest oceanic garbage patches, and even lakes located in pristine areas
contain significant amounts of debris. This was confirmed by a major international study led by Barbara
Leoni and Veronica Nava from the University of Milano-Bicocca.44
According to the 2021 report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), microplastic was
found in all freshwater bodies studied - including rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.45 For example, researchers
found that nearly 10,000 metric tons - or 22 million pounds - of plastic waste enter the Great Lakes from
the United States and Canada every year.46

Eventually, microplastic returns to humans through the consumption of fish and seafood.
Italian scientists have also discovered that fruits and vegetables contain millions of microplastic
particles. High concentrations were found in apples, pears, carrots, potatoes, lettuce, and broccoli. Notably,
fruit contained 2–3 times more microplastic particles than vegetables—ranging from 52,000 particles
per gram in lettuce to 223,000 particles per gram in apples.47
A study found that 81% of 159 tap water samples from around the world contained microplastics.48
Other research supports these findings, also detecting microplastic particles in bottled mineral water.
Interestingly, the number of particles was roughly the same in both glass and polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) bottles, with concentrations reaching 6,292 particles per liter.49, 50, 51
Researchers from the University of Newcastle (Australia) conducted a study52 to estimate how much
plastic the average person consumes. Their results showed that a person ingests about 250 grams of
plastic per year, equivalent to 50 plastic bags.53

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES
OF MICRO- AND NANOPLASTIC POLLUTION
How MNPs Disrupt Ecosystems at the Molecular Level
Plastic waste is found everywhere — from oceans and rivers to soil, air, and even glaciers.54
Long-term observations confirm that, unlike organic plant and animal matter, plastic does not undergo
active natural decomposition. It persists in the environment without participating in natural biodegradation
cycles.55 Engineered to resist breakdown, plastic has become a permanent fixture in the global ecosystem.
What was once hailed as a technological triumph has now become a source of significant ecological
disruption.
More than 13,000 chemical substances are used in the production of plastics. Of these, over
3,200—including monomers, additives, and processing aids—are potentially hazardous due to their
toxic properties.56

Impact of MNPs on Soil Properties and Ecosystems Degradation
Studies show that microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems—particularly agricultural soils—may
exceed levels in oceanic environments by 4 to 23 times,57 indicating significant plastic accumulation in
soils. Plastics enter soil through various pathways, including wastewater treatment facilities, mulching
practices, atmospheric deposition, and everyday consumer products. The widespread use of single-use
plastic items is closely tied to serious contamination of soils with microplastics (MP) and nanoplastics
(NP). Both natural and human-driven factors enable58 these tiny plastic particles to infiltrate soil layers,
disrupting critical environmental processes.59
Observations confirm the harmful effects of microplastics on ecosystems, impacting the structure
and function of microorganisms, plants, and soils (Fig. 15).

Research conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that the presence of plastic film
particles of various sizes in soil significantly increases the rate of water evaporation. The effect is especially
pronounced with the addition of 2-millimeter particles. Larger plastic fragments (5–10 mm) cause soil
cracking, disrupting its structural integrity. These findings suggest that plastic pollution interferes with
the water cycle in soils, which may exacerbate soil water shortages and affect the vertical transport of
pollutants60 (Fig. 16, 17).

Studies also confirm the adverse effects of plastics on soil biota—a diverse community that includes
microorganisms (such as bacteria and fungi) and fauna (both microscopic and macroscopic animals).
These organisms interact with each other, with plant roots, and with the surrounding environment to
form soil food chains (Fig. 18), which are essential for nutrient cycling and plant health.

Various types of terrestrial biota serve as bioindicators of microplastic pollution. All samples
analyzed contained microplastic particles and potentially toxic elements (Sb, As, Fe, Al, Se, Zn) in varying
concentrations, indicating61 the possible toxicity of microplastics.62
Research has shown that polystyrene beads can be ingested by the soil-dwelling nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 19); this also suggests that polystyrene particles may accumulate within
the soil food chain.63

Soil biota is more than just the “biological engine of the Earth”—it is a multifunctional system upon
which all terrestrial ecosystems depend. Its role in sustaining life on the planet is comparable to that of
the oceans and atmosphere, as confirmed by research in soil science, ecology, and climate studies. Any
disruption caused by toxicity can therefore impact numerous critical processes within the soil and its
food chain, leading to ecological imbalance.64
Findings show that microplastics can quickly adsorb to soil surfaces due to their small size, high
specific surface area, strong hydrophobicity, and resistance to biodegradation.65 These properties facilitate
easy uptake and accumulation in organisms, posing a potential threat to human health. This process is
not limited to the soil layer—it extends to plants, where microplastics continue to exert harmful effects.

MNPs in Food Products
Anthropogenic pollutants can significantly impact ecosystems, especially when they enter plant
systems. Microplastics have been confirmed to be absorbed and translocated into various parts of plants.
Research shows that microplastics accumulate in plant systems through multiple pathways, exerting
harmful effects on vegetation, agricultural crops, and food products.

Due to their extremely tiny size, nanoplastics can directly penetrate plant tissue.66 Plants absorb
nanoplastics from nutrient media, after which they are transported to aboveground parts through the
xylem—the vascular system responsible for transporting water and nutrients from roots to stems and
leaves.
Microplastics that settle on leaves can enter through stomata and may then move downward to
the roots via vascular bundles. Both micro- and nanoplastics exhibit toxic effects on the physiological
processes and enzymatic activity of agricultural plants (Fig. 20).67

The plant water transport system can rapidly carry nanoplastics to stems, leaves, and possibly fruits.
Research on tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) shows that while 100-nanometer nanoplastics do not
enter plant cells, smaller particles—20 to 40 nanometers in size—are successfully absorbed.68
Additionally, some plastic particles carry surface charges, which can enhance their adsorption to plant
roots through electrostatic attraction. This interaction may affect nutrient immobilization or interfere with
photosynthesis.69 Negatively charged microplastics are more likely to enter the root cortex.70

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

In agroecosystems heavily contaminated with these particles, studies report stunted plant growth,71
as well as short-term and transient effects on seed germination and root development.72
Studies confirm the presence of microplastics in commercially available honey, produced both
industrially and locally. Further analysis revealed the widespread presence of microplastics in the
inflorescences of various plant species.73, 74
In recent years, the state of global bee populations has seen a sharp decline. Research suggests that
one of the underestimated contributors may be environmental contamination from microplastics and
nanoplastics. Studies indicate that bees “collect” microplastics from the air, water, plants, and soil, then
carrying them back to their hives. Bees gather nectar and pollen from flowers, and they collect water
from natural sources — all of which already contain microplastic particles. The fine hairs covering bees’
bodies act as natural “traps” for these particles. Plastic particles also accumulate on their legs, particularly
in the joints and between segments, as they come into contact with plant surfaces, soil, water, and even
the hive itself.
“The honeybee is a very good biological indicator of environmental contamination
because it is ubiquitous, covered by hairs that capture contaminants and particles present in
the air, sensitive to pollutants, and has great mobility and wide flying range, among others”75

Micro- and nanoplastics also enter the bee’s body through the cuticle—the outer layer of its exoskeleton.
Once inside, plastic particles reach the brain within just three days, causing impairments in memory,
spatial orientation, and cognitive functions that are critical for foraging and navigation.76 The impact of
microplastics on the brain also reduces the bee’s ability to restore memory. This is particularly concerning,
as bees navigate using familiar environmental landmarks. Nanoplastics in the bee brain further impair
their ability to remember nectar sources, reduce responsiveness to floral scents, and disrupt their ability
to find their way back to the hive. Such cognitive dysfunctions directly decrease pollination efficiency
and may destabilize the entire colony.76

Once inside the bee’s body, nanoplastics also cause intestinal damage, weaken the immune system,
and increase susceptibility to viral infections—factors that can lead to bee mortality even in the absence
of acute plastic toxicity.75, 77 In addition, plastic fragments accumulate not only in bees themselves but
also in honey, wax, and larvae, creating a closed cycle of plastic contamination within the hive.75

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

This poses potentially serious implications not only for bee populations but also for global food
security. Bees are key pollinators, and their decline directly affects agricultural yields.
Brain damage, reduced body mass, and suppressed immunity lead to a decrease in pollination activity,
which researchers warn could exacerbate the crisis in global food production.77 Bees function as active
bioindicators of environmental pollution, and microplastics have already been detected in significant
quantities in honey, regardless of the country of origin.78
Microplastic exposure reduces overall chlorophyll content by 5.63–17.42%, leading to global losses in
rice, wheat, and corn production. These losses account for 4.11–13.52% of the total annual global yield
of these staple crops—an impact with serious implications for food security (Figure 22).79

Forests as Global Accumulators of Microplastics
Analyses have revealed the presence of nanoplastics in roots, stems, leaves, and needles across all
examined concentrations and time intervals. Nanoplastic concentrations in roots exceeded those in
aboveground parts by at least a factor of 10.
Plastic pollution negatively affects the functioning of both evergreen conifers and deciduous tree
species by inducing oxidative stress and reducing photosynthetic efficiency, potentially leading to growth
inhibition or even plant death.
Studies indicate that disruptions in photosynthetic stages cause the accumulation of excess light
energy. When this energy is not converted into chemical energy, it leads to photooxidative stress and
tissue damage. To mitigate this, plants activate photoprotective mechanisms, in which carotenoids
dissipate the excess energy as heat.80
By impairing photosynthesis, inducing oxidative stress, and lowering plant physiological activity,
plastic pollution increases ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. These findings underscore the
broad-scale impact of plastic contamination on plant communities and, by extension, raise concerns
about its consequences for terrestrial animals that depend on these ecosystems.

How Nanoplastics Destroy Fauna
Numerous studies indicate that the accumulation of micro- and nanoplastics in the environment,
including in plants, affects livestock production81 by disrupting food chains and impacting animal health.
Observations from a dairy farm in Italy showed that all samples of ryegrass hay contained microplastics.82
A study conducted in India found polyethylene terephthalate microplastic contamination in 100% of dairy
cattle feed samples, with concentrations ranging from 89 to 326 g/kg.83
Analysis confirmed the presence of microplastics in the follicular fluid of cattle,84 in milk,85 in sheep
feces,86 in beef, and in blood,87 pointing to significant impacts on ruminants.

According to available data, 50–60% of foreign objects retrieved from slaughtered livestock88—including
small ruminants such as goats and sheep—consisted of plastic materials. In addition, microplastics have
been detected in the internal tissues of urban dogs and cats,89 in the intestines of domestic ducks,90 and in
the lung tissue of pigs.91 Research findings confirm that microplastics harm animals not only directly, but
also through the additives used in their production and the pollutants they absorb from the surrounding
environment, causing damage of varying severity.92 Observations indicate that microplastics trigger toxic
effects in animals, including oxidative stress, intestinal damage, immunotoxicity, as well as reproductive
and neurotoxicity (Fig. 23).93

(C) Potential uptake and clearance mechanisms of
MPs (0.1 > 10 μm) in the lungs:
(a) There is a reduced chance of lung fluids
(surfactants and mucus) causing microplastic
displacement in the upper respiratory tract (central
lung) where the lung membrane is thicker. The ciliary
mucosa with particles >1 μm was cleared. Particles
<1 μm can be ingested through the epithelium.
(b) If the aerodynamic diameter of the microplastic
allows deposition deep in the lung, it may penetrate
the thinner lung fluid and contact the epithelium,
metastasizing through diffusion or active cell uptake.
(D) Predicted pathways for uptake of MPs from the
gastrointestinal tract (GIT):
(a) MPs uptake from GIT lumen by M cells of Pyle’s collecting lymph nodes through endocytosis (0.1 > 10 μm). M cells sample
and transport particles from the intestinal lumen to mucosal lymphoid tissue.
(b) MPs are absorbed from the GIT lumen by paracellular absorption. Non-degradable particles, such as MPs, can be mechanically
pinched into the underlying tissue through loose connections in the single-celled upper layer. Dendritic cells are able to devour
these particles, transporting them to lymph vessels and veins below. They may be distributed to secondary tissues, including
the liver, muscles, and brain

Moreover, microplastics act as carriers for contaminants such as heavy metals, antibiotics, persistent organic
compounds, and pesticides—further amplifying potential risks to ecosystems, animal health, and human health.94
Observational data indicate that wild animals often mistake plastic waste for food, leading to its
accumulation in their intestines. In Zimbabwe95 and Sri Lanka96, elephants that fed at open dumps died
from ingesting indigestible plastic. In Japan's Nara Park, wild deer died from complications caused by
swallowing plastic waste left by tourists97. A study of over 30,000 camels near Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates found that approximately 1% of the animals likely died due to plastic accumulated in their
digestive systems.98
Scientists coined the term "polybezoar" to describe a dense mass of indigestible materials—such
as plastic, rope, trash, and salt deposits—forming a stone-like concretion in the stomach or intestines,
especially in ruminants. The term combines “poly” (synthetic material) and “bezoar” (a hardened mass).
Observations confirm that polybezoars cause gastrointestinal blockages, sepsis from bacterial growth,
dehydration, and malnutrition (Fig. 24).

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Transfer of MNPs Via Food Chains From Plankton to Humans
The accumulation of plastics in the ocean has a significant negative impact on marine ecosystems.
Scientific observations over the past four decades have revealed microplastics in nearly all marine habitats
worldwide.99 Studies confirm that plastic debris affects marine biodiversity across a wide spectrum of
habitats. At least 690 marine species have been affected by plastic pollution globally, including cetaceans,
pinnipeds, seabirds, turtles, fish, and crustaceans.100 Ingesting plastic debris can also expose the animal
to an additional source of toxins. The chemical components can leach into the body following ingestion,
with pollutants transferred from prey to predator within food chains. The effects of entanglement or
ingestion can be lethal or sublethal in nature, and lead to a range of issues such as compromised feeding
capacity and digestion problems leading to malnutrition, disease, reduced reproductive output, reduced
growth rates, and shorter lifespan.101
Due to their small sizes, microplastics are ingested by plankton — a key component of marine food
chains. Plankton is consumed by many marine species, and those that do not feed on it directly eat
organisms that have already ingested it. In this way, microplastics become integrated into food chains
(Figs. 25–26).
In 1999, an analysis of surface water samples in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre revealed that the
mass of plastic exceeded the mass of zooplankton — the primary food source of the ecosystem — by
six times102, highlighting the dominance of plastic over living organisms in the ocean.
Estimates based on observational data indicate that the concentration of microplastics increases
with fish size.
Data show that the largest animal — the whale — ingests up to 43.6 kg of plastics daily, with 98.5 %
of this volume coming from prey, not directly from the water, since microplastics are already present in
the food it consumes.103

Plastics Kill Marine Organisms
Every year, around 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die due to pollution.104 Observations
confirm a link between ingested debris and seabird mortality. A study of 1,733 seabirds of 51 species
found that 557 (32.1 %) had ingested marine debris, ranging from 1–40 items, with a maximum weight
of 3,440 mg and volume of 3,621 mm3.105
Some data also show that certain plastics release dimethyl sulfide — a chemical compound that
mimics the olfactory signal used by seabirds to identify food.106 New research has also established that
plastics ingestion causes kidney, liver, and stomach damage in chicks, as well as brain lesions similar
to Alzheimer's disease. This highlights the destructive impact of plastic pollution on marine fauna.107
Plastic particles were found in every individual of all seven species of turtles across three oceanic basins
(Fig. 27).108

Studies of 171,774 individuals from 555 species of marine fish show that 386 species, including 210
commercially important species, consume plastic debris109. The incidence rate of plastic ingested by
fish was 26 %, doubling over the last decade (Fig. 28). Analysis revealed a positive correlation between
the abundance of plastic in surface waters (Fig. 29) and its consumption by marine organisms (Fig. 30).
Laboratory studies show that compounds from plastic, when absorbed into fish tissues, reduce activity,
impair liver function, damage the brain, and also delay growth and worsen reproductive fitness.109, 106, 107

Corals Under Threat: A Micro Threat of Global Scale
Plastic pollution poses a growing threat to coral reefs by entering their food chains, exacerbating the
spread of diseases, and contributing to the degradation of reef communities. Analysis has identified
anthropogenic debris on 77 out of 84 surveyed reefs, including isolated atolls in the central Pacific
Ocean.112 Negative health impacts, such as bleaching and tissue necrosis,113 have been recorded in five
out of six studied species114 (Fig. 31).
Larger plastic fragments facilitate the transmission of diseases and physical damage, increasing
coral vulnerability to pathogens.115 These effects also impact the skeletal microbiome, which plays a
crucial role in maintaining the health of coral colonies116 (Fig. 32). Research further reveals that biofilms
on microplastics, known as “plastispheres,”114 can induce microbiome dysbiosis in corals.117
When in contact with plastics, the risk of coral disease increases from 4 % to 89 % (Fig. 33). The death
of coral reefs significantly impacts biodiversity loss, as reefs provide habitat for a quarter of marine
species.115

Figure 31: Impact of plastics on coral reef health
Corals can respond with a variety of cleaning mechanisms (e.g., ciliary action, mucus production, or tissue expansion),
retention of particles through overgrowing, or egestion of mistakenly ingested particles.

Impact of MNPs on the Oxygen Balance in Ecosystems
Observations show that plastics in the environment primarily degrade due to solar radiation. This
process alters their chemical composition and structure. Research confirms that reactions triggered by
sunlight enhance the leaching of dissolved organic compounds, which impacts the biogeochemistry of
seawater and stimulates the growth of heterotrophic bacteria118 (Fig. 34).

Long-term studies show that the chemical compounds released by plastics into seawater during
their degradation originate either from the material itself or from additives used to provide color or
stability to the polymer. Some of the compounds are organic acids, which explains their role in reducing
pH. Therefore, plastics contribute to intensification of ocean acidification (Fig. 35), which, in turn, can
significantly disrupt the functioning of Earth's natural systems.119

surface areas, plastic degradation will lead to a drop of up to 0.5 pH units, which is
comparable to the pH drop estimated in the worst anthropogenic emissions scenarios

Ocean acidification is a disruption of marine conditions, creating persistent and growing environmental
pressure.121 The consequences for ecosystems unfold over decades, centuries, and longer. Observations
confirm a reduction in biodiversity in coastal systems due to a decrease in pH.122, 123This lowers ecosystem
resilience and threatens essential functions, including habitat provision, nutrient cycling, and carbon
storage.123
Research indicates that with ocean acidification, mussels (Mytilus edulis) grow slower and have reduced
survival rates (Fig. 37). This decreases their population, which in turn reduces their ability to filter water
and maintain coastal ecosystem quality.124
Current ocean surface pH levels are unprecedented at least for the past 26,000 years.125 This process
has a significant impact on coral reefs, deep-sea ecosystems, and high-latitude ecosystems, which rely
on unique species. Those species play an irreplaceable role, and their extinction disrupts key ecosystem
functions, as there are no equivalents capable of replacing them.126

Figure 37: Slime acts as a barrier, preventing harmful substances, microorganisms, or
parasites from entering the organism. It can capture and expel potentially dangerous
particles, including microplastics, from the gills and digestive system.
Oysters and mussels show a noticeable decline in population along gradients of decreasing
carbonate saturation. Ocean acidification may lead to a reduction in oyster populations and the
ecosystem services they provide in the wild; it may also degrade their quality as seafood.

Research confirms that microplastics have considerable negative effects on biological parameters like
growth127, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of microalgae.128, 129
Data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12%
in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae.130 Photosynthesis is known to be the primary
process on Earth that produces molecular oxygen (O2), which is released into the atmosphere.
Microplastics in marine sediments alter microbial communities and disrupt nitrogen cycling, potentially
magnifying human-caused problems like toxic algal blooms. Changes in plankton communities at the
ocean surface could exacerbate deoxygenation driven by climate change, starving marine organisms
of oxygen.131
Data shows that from 1960 to 2010, the ocean lost 2 % of its dissolved oxygen due to rising water
temperatures and the accumulation of pollutants, including industrial, household, and agricultural runoff.132
The decrease in oxygen leads to the formation of dead zones — areas of the ocean where marine flora
and fauna have almost completely disappeared. Observations indicate that in the 1960s, there were
45 dead zones in the world's oceans, whereas by 2011, their number had increased to around 700.133
According to data published on the UNDP website, the number of dead zones has been doubling every
decade since the 1960s. Based on this trend, it is highly likely that the number could reach 1,500 by
2025.134 Plastic pollution impacts many processes in the Earth's system. According to research, it may
exacerbate critical environmental issues such as biodiversity loss and climate change.135

IMPACT OF MICRO- AND NANOPLASTICS
ON THE CLIMATE
Ocean Functions
The ocean plays a key role in maintaining the planet’s climate balance, functioning as a natural “air
conditioner.” Its unique ability to absorb and gradually release heat helps moderate temperature fluctuations
on Earth. Just a ten-meter layer of ocean water can absorb more heat than the entire Earth’s atmosphere
(Fig. 38). This reduces temperature swings both during the day and night (Fig. 39), as well as between
seasons — summer and winter.

Figure 38: Comparative heat capacity of the ocean and the atmosphere: despite a lower mass of air, the
ocean is able to accumulate and retain tens of times more heat, playing a key role in regulating Earth's climate

Ocean currents carry warm water from the tropics to colder regions, such as the northern latitudes.
This helps moderate the climate in coastal areas. Cold currents, in turn, return cooled water back toward
the equator. In this way, the ocean regulates the planet’s climate.
The ocean has a major impact on atmospheric processes and plays a key role in the formation of
clouds and precipitation. Every day, a vast amount of water evaporates from its surface, later condensing
into clouds and falling back to Earth as rain or snow. This process is vital for replenishing freshwater
resources in rivers, lakes, and soil.
Microscopic algae in the ocean, such as phytoplankton (Fig. 40), produce more than 50% of the
oxygen.136 Many ocean chemistry and biology models predict that as the ocean surface warms in response
to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, phytoplankton productivity will decline (Fig. 41).137, 138

plant-like diatoms, to armor-plated coccolithophores (drawings not to scale). (Collage adapted from drawings

Changing Ocean Temperature Patterns
The State of the Global Ocean Report 2024 demonstrates a troubling picture — an unprecedented
ocean heating trend.
Studies show that between 1960 and 1986, ocean temperatures rose at a steady rate. However, in
recent decades, this process has accelerated twofold (Fig. 41).139

The middle depths of a part of the Pacific Ocean have warmed 15 times faster in the past 60 years
than they did during the previous 10,000 years (Figs. 45–46).145 This indicates that the processes of
global warming affect not only the upper ocean layers, but also deeper regions where sunlight does not
reach. Heating water at such depths requires an enormous amount of energy, underscoring the scale
of the problem. According to scientists, for the ocean to warm at its current rate, it would take an energy
release equivalent to the explosion of 7 atomic bombs every second for an entire year146 — staggering
figures that raise a question: where is this energy coming from?
Rising ocean temperatures inevitably lead to sea level rise, threatening to engulf entire coastlines.
Over the past two centuries, the global mean sea level has risen by 21 centimeters (8.3 inches), and in
the last 30 years alone — by 10.1 centimeters (3.98 inches).147 The current rate of increase is 2.5 times
higher than before, and this trend is expected to continue. If the situation doesn’t change, millions of
people will become climate refugees, forced to leave their homes and seek shelter far from the coasts.
“The rise we saw in 2024 was higher than we expected,” said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “Every year is a little bit different, but what’s
clear is that the ocean continues to rise, and the rate of rise is getting faster and faster.”148 (Fig. 47).

Ocean warming also contributes to more frequent and intense extreme weather events, such as floods,
typhoons, and abnormal precipitation. These changes threaten the planet’s ecosystems and the lives of
billions of people, and with each passing year, their impact becomes more evident.

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Why is the Ocean Warming? Hypothesis
The main widely recognized factors contributing to ocean warming are greenhouse gases, such
as CO2, which trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of the ocean’s upper layers.
However, there are other factors that may also have a significant impact on this process. One additional
factor influencing ocean warming will be discussed in the chapter “X Factor.”
Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a sharp increase in the amount of plastics in
the oceans, coinciding with a period of rapid industrial development and the mass production of plastic
goods (Fig. 48).
Between 1960 and 2019, a change in ocean temperature has also been observed. The chart (Fig. 49)
shows a parallel increase in the mean sea surface temperature, which has likewise been recorded since
the mid-20th century.
When comparing the two charts (Figs. 48–49), a correlation can be observed between the rise in
oceanic plastics concentrations and the warming of ocean waters. This suggests that plastic pollution
in the oceans may be one of the significant, yet insufficiently studied, factors contributing to the heating
of ocean waters.

To further explore this issue, it is important to understand whether plastics can affect the physical
properties of ocean water, such as thermal conductivity and heat capacity. And can these changes
contribute to rising ocean temperatures? To gain a better understanding of these processes, let’s examine
the fundamental properties of water and how it interacts with pollutants.

Fundamental Properties of Water
A water molecule has a symmetrical V-shape, with two hydrogen atoms positioned on one side relative
to the larger oxygen atom (Fig. 50).

Figure 50:

water molecule: two hydrogen (H)

(O) atom at an angle of ~104.5°,

This structure differs from linear molecules, such as CO2, where all atoms are arranged in a straight
line. The unique shape of the water molecule makes it vital for numerous processes on Earth.
The specific properties of water molecules allow water to remain in a liquid state at temperatures that
would typically cause other triatomic molecules to become gases (Fig. 51).

Figure 51: The melting points (left) and
boiling points (right) of isoelectronic
sequences of hydride molecules.
The temperatures for water are
significantly higher than expected
when extrapolating the data for similar
compounds.

Chemical Bond, 3rd ed., Chapter 12-2,
Cornell Univ. Press, 1960.

This is due to hydrogen bonds149 that connect water molecules, forming a strong and orderly structure.
Most hydrogen bonds are weak attractions, with bond strength approximately one-tenth that of a
typical covalent bond. Nonetheless, they are extremely important. Without them, all wooden structures
would collapse, cement would crumble, oceans would evaporate, and all living matter would disintegrate
into inanimate substances.150
That is why water has the ability to form clusters, which explains many of its anomalous properties
(Figs. 52–53). Water clusters can cover over 95% of hydrogen bond network, among which some clusters
maximally encompass thousands of molecules extending beyond 3.0 nanometers.151

Heat Capacity, Thermal Conductivity, and Density of Water, and Their Functional Significance
1. High Heat Capacity of Water
Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquid or solid under normal conditions, second
only to a few gases such as hydrogen.152This means water can absorb, retain, and transfer large amounts
of heat energy while undergoing only a relatively small change in its own temperature.
Water’s heat capacity is calculated as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram
of water by 1 degree Celsius and is approximately 4.18 J/(g·°C) under standard conditions. This property
is one of the key factors in climate regulation: ocean water accumulates heat during the day and gradually
releases it at night. In summer, the ocean absorbs excess heat, whereas in winter, it slowly releases it,
acting as a giant thermostat and reducing temperature fluctuations across the planet.
2. Thermal Conductivity of Water
Water has relatively low thermal conductivity compared to metals, but it is higher than that of many
other liquids. Thermal conductivity reflects a substance’s ability to transfer heat from one its part to
another without the movement of the substance itself. Under standard conditions (25 °C), water’s thermal
conductivity is approximately 0.6 W/(m·K), which makes it an efficient conductor of heat in natural
processes such as heat distribution in oceans and other water bodies.

Studies show that the thermal conductivity of water increases with rising temperature, up to a certain
point.152 In addition, this value can vary in the presence of impurities or dissolved substances.153, 154
These characteristics influence the way heat is distributed in water, which is critical to understanding
the interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere.
3. Anomalous Behavior of Water Density
Unlike that of most substances, the density of water behaves unusually as temperature changes. When
water cools down to 4 °C, its density increases, but when cooled further (from 4 °C to 0 °C), its density
begins to decrease (Fig. 54). When water freezes, its density drops by about 8–9 %. This explains why
ice floats instead of sinking. This phenomenon is critically important for life in water bodies because
ice protects the underlying water and living organisms from freezing and prevents water from freezing
solid all the way to the bottom.

Figure 54: Schematic representation of the change in water density
during cooling: As water cools, the molecules come closer together
(increasing density) to a point. Water is most dense at about 40
degrees F (4° C). As water cools further, the hydrogens push against
each other, aligning in a certain way as ice crystals form, expanding
and making ice about 10 percent less dense than liquid water.

Influence of Water Properties on Climate and Ecosystems
Changes in water temperature can significantly affect the thermal balance of the World Ocean and
its ability to retain and transfer heat. This, in turn, will impact Earth's climate system.
Thus, the physicochemical properties of water, especially its heat capacity and thermal conductivity,
play a vital role in maintaining environmental balance on the planet and regulating climate processes
(Fig. 55).

Figure 55: Schematic representation of hydrogen bonds in water molecules and their impact on key
properties of water: Hydrogen bonds contribute to water’s high heat capacity, allowing it to efficiently
absorb and retain heat. These bonds also determine water’s density—maximal at 4°C—as well as its ability
to dissolve polar and ionic substances, making water a universal solvent.

Role of MNPs in Altering Seawater’s Physical Properties
As products of the petrochemical industry, plastics do not biodegrade in nature. Instead, they break down
into smaller particles, such as micro- and nanoplastics.155 Those particles, especially nanoplastics, can
significantly affect the physical and chemical properties of water, which in turn can influence ecosystems
and climate processes.
Nanoplastics are particles measured in nanometers, meaning they are smaller than a virus (Fig. 56).

For instance, nylon (polyamide) nanoplastics, which contain nitrogen and oxygen, can form hydrogen
bonds with water.156 When nanoplastic particles enter water, they disrupt the ordered structure of hydrogen
bonds between water molecules. This can alter the water’s physicochemical properties (Fig. 57).
In particular, the mobility of water molecules decreases, which reduces their ability to efficiently participate
in heat exchange processes. Moreover, in aqueous solutions containing various substances, plastic
nanoparticles may acquire an electric charge.157

water conditions, such as the presence of organic or synthetic impurities, changes in pH, temperature, or

This is due to chemical changes on their surface, such as oxidation and adsorption of ions, e.g.,
sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-), in seawater. Charged plastic nanoparticles surrounded by ions attract
water molecules and form a hydrate shell around them158 (Fig. 58).

Researchers from the Polytechnic School of Lausanne (EPFL) decided to find out the size of this
hydrate shell of ions, that is, how many water molecules react to an ion. It turned out that one ion can
influence about a million water molecules around it. This effect is enhanced if a particle has a large
surface charge and a high concentration of adsorbed ions. Therefore, a single nanoplastic particle can
change the properties of millions of water molecules158 (Fig. 59). The molecules bound in a hydrate shell
are less mobile.159 As a result, the total heat capacity of the water is reduced.160, 161

Disruption of hydrogen bond structures also leads to a decrease in thermal conductivity.162 Consequently,
water may remain heated near nanoplastics, as it loses its ability to effectively transfer heat.

Areas of Micro- and Nanoplastics Concentration in the Ocean
Micro- and nanoplastics can be dispersed throughout the ocean by currents, while denser particles
or contaminated plastics can settle on the ocean floor. Accumulation of nanoplastics is also observed
in the thermocline areas — transitional layers between warm surface waters and colder deep waters163
(Fig. 60).

Figure 60: The image illustrates a figurative comparison between areas of micro- and nanoplastic
concentration in the ocean and a multistory building with thermal blockages on the 5th and 10th floors.
The blockages hinder normal heat exchange, causing heat to accumulate on these floors instead of being
evenly distributed. A thermal camera would show that the temperature inside the building is significantly
higher than in a similar building without blockages. Similarly, nanoplastics disrupt natural heat exchange
mechanisms in water, creating “thermal blockages” in the ocean.

Increased concentrations of nanoplastics in the oceans can cause changes in the global heat balance.
This can influence the rise in ocean temperatures, potentially causing climate change. It's important to
note that even a small amount of nanoplastic can have a significant impact on ecosystems. A rise in
ocean surface temperature accelerates fragmentation of plastic waste into micro- and nanoplastics
(Fig. 61). Consequently, the number of these particles increases, and they enter the atmosphere along
with water vapor. The presence of micro- and nanoplastics in the atmosphere contributes to further
warming, which in turn intensifies the warming of the ocean. Thus, a feedback loop is formed, where
the processes mutually reinforce each other.

Link Between the MNP Electrostatic Charge
and Atmospheric Phenomena
Micro- and nanoplastics enter the atmosphere through various pathways. Water vapor evaporating from
the surface of oceans and other water bodies carries microparticles into the air.164 On land, the primary
sources of atmospheric plastics include factories, waste incineration plants, and landfills. Additionally,
microplastics are lifted into the air when agricultural fertilizers and plastic mulch dry out and are dispersed
by winds. Microplastic particles are also released through the friction of automobile tires.
These and many other sources contribute significantly to atmospheric pollution. These processes
promote accumulation and spread of microplastics in the atmosphere, creating serious environmental
and climate-related threats. Once in the atmosphere, micro- and nanoplastic particles can serve as
condensation nuclei for water vapor. The greater the number of such nuclei, the faster the condensation
of water vapor into droplets occurs. Airborne microplastics have been found in cloud water samples
collected from mountaintops in Japan165 (Fig. 62).

“In a polluted environment with many more aerosol particles, like microplastics, you
are distributing the available water among many more aerosol particles, forming smaller
droplets around each of those particles. When you have more droplets, you get less rain,
but because droplets only rain once they get large enough, you collect more total water
in the cloud before the droplets are large enough to fall and, as a result, you get heavier
rainfall when it comes,” said Miriam Friedman, Professor of Chemistry of Penn State’s
Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science.166

This explains why anomalous precipitation has been observed in various regions in recent years.

Electric Charges in Clouds
Earth’s atmosphere is a complex electrical system in which water molecules play a vital role.
Since 1752, when Benjamin Franklin first demonstrated that the atmosphere is electrified and thunderstorms
have an electrical nature, it has become clear that water, in the form of vapor, liquid, and ice, plays a key
role in these processes. While pure water is electrically neutral, during phase changes such as melting
and freezing, as well as during collisions between molecules, it can transfer ions to other particles. This
leads to a buildup of electric charges and contributes to atmospheric electrical phenomena.
In the atmosphere, collisions between ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, and other particles,
especially in the presence of natural electric fields, cause separation of charges. This process plays a
key role in the development of atmospheric electricity, including formation of thunderclouds. It is also
essential to formation of clouds and precipitation. Electrically charged droplets are drawn towards each
other, accelerating their coalescence into larger drops. This ultimately leads to the formation of clouds
capable of producing precipitation such as rain, snow, or hail.

“Charges are really important, and in cloud formation, charges are practically everything.
And what we found is that charges are critical,” said Gerald H. Pollack, PhD, professor
of bioengineering at the University of Washington, editor-in-chief and founder of the
interdisciplinary research journal WATER.167

In 1843, Michael Faraday discovered that electricity can be generated when water droplets rub against
metal surfaces, effectively charging the water. This finding sparked further research into how water
becomes electrically charged through friction, phase transitions and contact electrification, and even
resulted in efforts to harness this effect for new energy sources.
It is known that humid air can neutralize surface charges by forming a thin water film that allows
ions to move and dissipate built-up charge. However, in some cases, surfaces that absorb water can
actually accumulate charge from a moist atmosphere, which also influences the surrounding electrical
environment.168 Research has also shown that heavy metals can easily bind to microplastics, and this
combination may pose serious risks to global ecosystems.

Moreover, microplastics and the mix of substances on their surface can not only stick to other pollutants,
but also interact with each other, altering their chemical properties.169 When micro- and nanoplastic
particles enter the atmosphere, they can disrupt the delicate balance of atmospheric processes. Plastic
particles may carry a charge, enhancing the attraction of polar water molecules and promoting the
formation of droplets. Unlike typical condensation nuclei such as pollen, sea salt, or soot, plastic particles
can gather droplets more efficiently than neutral particles.170
This means that water droplets begin to form more quickly around charged particles, which affects
cloud structure and may lead to the formation of larger droplets and even abnormally large ice crystals.171
For instance, a recent study by a group of researchers found plastic pellets with water-attracting surfaces
in clouds at mountain peaks in Japan.172

Impact on Cloud Formation and Precipitation
Microplastics can influence the nature of precipitation, weather forecasting, climate modeling, and
even flight safety by affecting how atmospheric ice crystals form clouds.
A study173 has shown that water droplets containing microplastics freeze at temperatures 4–10 °C
higher than droplets without them, meaning they freeze at lower altitudes. Typically, a water droplet without
any impurities freezes at around −38°C. However, in the case of microplastics, 50 % of the droplets froze
at −18 to −24 degrees Celsius, depending on the type of plastic.
Water droplets containing microplastics freeze faster, forming larger ice particles. Those particles are
carried upwards by air currents, repeatedly coated with layers of ice, and then fall to the ground. This
kind of phenomenon can lead to an increase in the size of hailstones (Figs. 63−64), intensifying their
destructive impact and accelerating the formation of ice clouds. As a result, the frequency and intensity
of precipitation, including rain and snow, may change. This can trigger cascading effects that impact
the climate, the hydrological cycle, and ecosystems.
When nanoplastic particles are present in the atmosphere, clouds begin to form at lower altitudes —
typically below 6,500 feet. This causes clouds to become less mobile, which disrupts normal precipitation
patterns. Consequently, some areas may experience drought, while others receive excessive rainfall.

Role of MNPs in Disrupting Earth’s Climate Balance
Denser clouds begin to trap heat in lower layers of the atmosphere, acting like a blanket by absorbing
and re-radiating thermal energy back toward Earth’s surface. This reduces the amount of heat escaping
into space and contributes to atmospheric warming. Rising temperatures lead to increased evaporation
from the oceans, while more moisture in the air further amplifies the warming, creating a self-reinforcing
cycle. Notably, for every 1 °C (1.8 °F) increase in temperature, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere
rises by approximately 7 %,174 and the frequency of lightning strikes increases by about 12 %.175

As noted by Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished climatologist at the U.S. National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and a lead author of IPCC reports, “Those two ingredients,
the increased temperature and the increased water vapor, lead to increased instability
of the atmosphere. And what that leads to is more convection, more storms, some of
which, the more severe ones, become thunderstorms. And there's a greater risk of strong
thunderstorms as a result. And if the thunderstorms get together and cooperate, as they
do in a tropical storm, you can end up with stronger hurricanes as well. And so, all of
those things are adding together. And there's an increased risk of the kinds of storms,
the severe thunderstorms, the supercell storms especially that produce the hail and also
can in some places in the right conditions, produce tornadoes.”

Thus, extreme ocean heating along with excess electricity and heat in the atmosphere is worsening
the climate situation, causing more destructive weather events such as severe thunderstorms, hurricanes,
lightning, and sprites.
In the atmosphere, plastics do not just pollute the environment, but also disrupt climate processes
by influencing cloud formation and precipitation. They enhance electrostatic charge in the atmosphere,
accelerate condensation of water vapor, and affect cloud density — factors that can increase the intensity
of storms, thunderstorms, and other extreme weather events. We are on the brink of understanding the
full scale of this impact on the climate, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive action to reduce
plastic particle pollution in both the oceans and the atmosphere.

Interaction Between the Ocean and Earth’s Magnetic Field
The oceans cover about 70 % of Earth’s surface and are far more than vast reservoirs of water: they
play a crucial role in the planet’s complex electrical systems. They interact with Earth’s magnetic field
and actively participate in its electromagnetic processes.
Earth’s magnetic field acts as a natural shield, protecting the planet’s surface from solar wind and
cosmic radiation. Without it, our atmosphere would be stripped away. This geomagnetic field is generated
deep within the planet where the liquid outer core, composed of metals, moves around the solid inner
core, creating a natural generator through a process known as geodynamo (Fig. 65).

Figure 65: Schematic illustration of the geomagnetic field formation process:
Earth's liquid outer core spins around its solid inner core, acting like a natural
generator known as geodynamo that produces the planet's magnetic field.

Earth’s magnetic field interacts with electrical phenomena in both the oceans and the atmosphere.
Seawater, rich in salts and dissolved ions, is highly conductive and capable of carrying electric currents.
Those currents, in turn, interact with the planet’s magnetic field, generating complex electromagnetic
processes that influence the dynamics of Earth’s geomagnetic system.

As previously discussed, ocean pollution, particularly from micro- and nanoplastics, can alter the
chemical and electrical properties of seawater. The higher the concentration of pollutants, the more
natural electromagnetic processes are disrupted. When polluted water evaporates, it can carry with it
metals, microplastics, and other substances, potentially influencing atmospheric processes.
During evaporation, microscopic droplets and aerosols can transport micro- and nanoplastics, heavy
metals176, and other contaminants into the atmosphere, where they may affect local electromagnetic
conditions. This process is somewhat analogous to placing a metallic object near a magnet: it distorts
the magnetic field and weakens its strength in specific areas.
The impact of ocean pollution on Earth’s magnetic field requires further research, especially in the
context of global climate change. A deeper understanding of these processes can help scientists assess
their potential effects on the planet’s climate system and ecosystems.

Micro- and Nanoplastics as Emerging Risk Factors
in the 21st-Century Epidemics
Over the past 30 years, there has been a steady rise in heart attacks, strokes, cancer, diabetes, allergies,
and inflammatory bowel diseases. A decline in immune function is being observed in both children and
adults worldwide. Infertility is becoming more widespread. Even though data on the number of infertile
individuals and couples remains limited, the World Health Organization estimates that around 17.5 % of
the adult population177 — roughly 1 in 6 worldwide — experience infertility.
Since 2010, a decline in intellectual abilities has been observed. Even in developed countries, 25% of
adults struggle with basic math problems; in the United States, this figure reaches 35%. Attention span,
logical thinking, and the ability to solve simple tasks are deteriorating. The prevalence of various forms
of dementia and cognitive impairment is growing.178
The rise in mental health disorders has overtaken the growth of physical illnesses.179 Anxiety disorders,
autism, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are reaching
pandemic levels.
There is growing evidence that micro- and nanoplastics play a role in the development of these health
conditions.

Molecular Mechanisms of MNP Toxicity:
Destruction of DNA, Mitochondria, and Cell Membranes
Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are among the most widespread forms of anthropogenic pollution
in the environment. Due to their physical and chemical properties, plastic particles can travel long
distances, crossing both geographic and ecological barriers. The main pathways through which micro- and
nanoplastics enter the human body are ingestion (through water and food), inhalation (from the air), and
absorption through the skin (Fig. 66).180
As mentioned in Part 1: “Plastics in the Environment: Scale of the Problem,” the marine environment
serves as a major source of secondary microplastics. According to estimates, marine breezes carry
about 136,000 tons of microplastics to coastal areas each year. Additionally, open bodies of water in
urban areas — including wastewater and stormwater systems — have become significant centers for
the accumulation and further spread of plastic particles, with concentrations that may exceed previous
estimates by up to 90%.
Food products represent a major pathway for MNPs to enter the human body. Plants are capable of
accumulating nanoplastics through their root systems: during irrigation or rainfall, particles enter the soil
and are absorbed with water, moving through the xylem and accumulating in leaf and fruit tissues.181
The highest concentrations of plastic particles have been found in crops such as apples, pears, carrots,
and broccoli.
Seafood is another route for the transfer of MNPs. The ingestion of microplastics by marine organisms
has been recorded at all trophic levels. According to research by Newcastle University, the average person
may consume up to 250 grams of microplastics per year — approximately 5 grams per week, or the weight
of one plastic credit card. Moreover, when plastic containers — including baby food packaging — are
heated in microwave ovens, more than 2 billion nanoparticles and 4 million microparticles of plastic can
be released into the food per square centimeter of surface area.
Microplastics are widespread in drinking water. Studies show that up to 90% of tap water samples in
the United States contain MNPs. Major sources of contamination include wastewater runoff, industrial
emissions, and atmospheric deposition of airborne plastics. When contaminated water evaporates,
plastic particles can rise into the atmosphere and later fall with rain or snow. A study conducted across
11 U.S. national parks recorded more than 1,000 tons of plastic particles falling with precipitation over
just 14 months — enough to produce 120 million plastic bottles.

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Aerosol transmission of MNPs is considered one of the most dangerous exposure pathways for
humans. Plastic particles are lifted from the surfaces of oceans and bodies of water, transported by air
currents, and become part of atmospheric aerosols. Estimates suggest that in a major city, an adult can
inhale up to 106,000 microplastic particles during a two-hour walk. In areas near bodies of water, this
figure can be ten times higher.
A new study presented at the American College of Cardiology conference (ACC.25) revealed that higher
exposure to microplastics — which can be unintentionally ingested or inhaled — is associated with an
increased prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases. The research found that communities
located along the East and West Coasts, the Gulf Coast, and certain lakeshores in the U.S. showed
higher concentrations of microplastics in the environment, which correlated with greater rates of chronic
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke.

“This study provides initial evidence that microplastics exposure has an impact on
cardiovascular health, especially chronic, noncommunicable conditions like high blood
pressure, diabetes and stroke,” said Sai Rahul Ponnana, MA, a research data scientist at
Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Ohio and the study's lead author. “When we
included 154 different socioeconomic and environmental features in our analysis, we
didn't expect microplastics to rank in the top 10 for predicting chronic noncommunicable
disease prevalence.”182

Micro- and nanoplastics have been found capable of penetrating and crossing biological barriers,
including those of the intestine, lungs, brain, and placenta.183 Microplastics exposed to fresh or marine
water more easily penetrate cells (Fig. 67) due to the accumulation of biomolecules on their surface.
These biomolecules form a coating (eco-corona) that helps microplastics pass through the digestive
tract and integrate into tissues. This coating acts as a facilitator, enhancing the particles’ internalization
into cells much like a “Trojan horse.”184

There are many factors that may influence the toxicity of microplastics, including size, shape, surface
charge, weathering/aging process, adsorption, etc.185 Smaller particles penetrate cells more easily and
cause more pronounced oxidative stress. The surface charge of microplastics is a key factor in determining
how efficiently they are taken up by cells, as it affects adhesion. In addition, microplastics are composed
of polymers and various chemical additives, which further increase their harmful effects.183
Micro- and nanoplastic particles, the chemical compounds used in plastics, and pollutants from the
surrounding environment that plastics absorb — all act together in a complex186 and harmful way, posing
a significant threat to human health (Fig. 68).

Just one gram of microplastic can contain up to 24,000 nanograms of persistent organic pollutants.187
These substances are highly toxic, accumulate in organisms, and can cause harm even in small
concentrations.
Microplastics can also make other contaminants more dangerous,188 since both the plastic itself
and the chemical mixture on its surface can not only stick to other pollutants but also interact with
them — altering their chemical properties.
Studies show that exposure to micro- and nanoplastics cause serious toxicity to various biological
organisms including:
•

Macromolecules: DNA & gene damage, affected gene expression, and altered protein transcription.

•

Organelle cells: Altered cellular division, cellular toxicity, apoptosis, oxidative stress reaction,
metabolism, increased calcium ions.

•

Tissues: Inflammation, fibrosis, and bone tissue osteolysis.

•

Organs: Immune responses, organ dysfunction, neurotoxicity, carcinogenesis, altered feeding,
changed metabolic demand, and energy reserves redistribution.

•

Animal and Human Populations: Reduced fertility, slower growth, and reduced population.

These effects highlight the multilevel impact of micro- and nanoplastics on biological systems.189

1. Disruption of Cellular Function
The destruction of the human body under the influence of micro- and nanoplastics begins at the
cellular level.190 MNPs interact with cell membranes through various bonds (e.g., hydrogen, halogen) or
hydrophobic, van der Waals, and electrostatic forces.
Acting as a destabilizing factor, MNPs disrupt the integrity and function of cellular membranes (Fig. 69).

A key aspect of their destructive action at the cellular level is the damage to cell membranes,
mitochondria, and the destruction of DNA.
Electrostatically charged micro- and nanoplastic particles can destabilize the membrane potential
of cells — especially neurons — leading to spontaneous electrical signals, failures in intercellular
communication, or cell death.
Inside the cell, the main target of nanoplastics’ destructive effect is the mitochondria — the
essential organelles responsible for the cell’s survival and recovery (Fig. 71). Beyond acting as the cell’s
“powerhouses,” mitochondria perform multifunctional roles, influencing overall health, resistance to
stress, the development of chronic diseases, and the aging process.

Figure 71: Schematic illustration of a cell and its mitochondria

80

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Proper mitochondrial function is vital for cell survival, homeostasis, and energy production. The
structure and functionality of mitochondria are maintained by the mitochondrial quality control system,
which includes mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics (fusion and fission), mitophagy, and the mitochondrial
unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Mitochondrial dysfunction or damage has been linked to the onset
and progression of numerous human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular
conditions, age-related illnesses, diabetes, and cancer. Environmental stress and pollutants can heighten
mitochondrial vulnerability, triggering dysfunction.
Growing evidence points to the impact of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) on mitochondrial health.
MNPs have been shown to induce oxidative stress and increase the production of reactive oxygen species,
ultimately disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential. These particles can cross biological barriers
in the human body and be absorbed by cells, potentially altering mitochondrial dynamics, bioenergetics,
and signaling pathways — thereby affecting cellular metabolism and function.
Given the mitochondria's critical role in both cellular and overall health, MNPs represent a serious
threat to mitochondrial integrity. Current findings emphasize the urgent need to address the widespread
issue of MNP pollution — not only to protect the environment but also to safeguard human health.192
Mitochondria synthesize ATP — the universal energy molecule that powers all biological processes,
from muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission to hormone production and cell division. They
are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids, helping to maintain the body’s
metabolic balance.
Mitochondria also regulate cell death, or apoptosis — a critically important process that prevents the
accumulation of damaged or potentially dangerous cells. Disruptions in this system are linked to the
development of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.
Additionally, mitochondria play a key role in antioxidant defense by regulating levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). When this system fails, cellular damage accumulates, aging accelerates, and the risk of
chronic inflammation and disease increases (Fig. 72).

Mitochondria contain their own DNA, which is inherited maternally, making them unique contributors
to genetic diseases. They regulate the activity of nuclear genes and help cells adapt to changes in their
external environment. Mitochondria also plays a role in the synthesis of steroid hormones — including
cortisol, estrogens, and testosterone.
Disruption of mitochondrial function due to exposure to nanoplastics lies at the core of a cascade of
pathological processes. These can lead to serious and potentially irreversible consequences — not only
in individual organs and systems, but in the body as a whole (Table 1).

Role of MNPs in Premature Aging and Cancer Development
Exposure to nanoplastics can trigger premature aging by interfering with mitochondrial function and
disrupting the body's genetic programs. Mitochondrial damage leads to excessive production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative stress. This, in turn, damages DNA, undermines genetic stability,
triggers inflammation, and accelerates tissue aging. Additionally, nanoplastics contribute to the shortening
of telomeres, limiting the cell's ability to divide.

“We also were able to show in humans how a single nucleotide change in mitochondrial
DNA that’s specifically associated with poor function of mitochondria and causing
pediatric mitochondrial disorders can accelerate aging,” said Taosheng Huang, MD, PhD,
Professor and Chief of Genetics in the Department of Pediatrics at the Jacobs School of
Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. “We found that reactive oxygen species due
to poor function of mitochondria leads to increased DNA damage over time.”193

Epigenetic aging refers to changes in gene regulation that occur through modifications at the DNA
level (switching genes on or off), without altering the DNA itself. It's a subtle “molecular clock” that can
be measured, and it may run faster or slower than chronological aging. High mitochondrial DNA activity
is linked to accelerated epigenetic aging. In some individuals, even in their 20s and 30s, the biological age
of cells can significantly surpass their chronological age, meaning their bodies age faster than expected.
People with mitochondrial dysfunction often develop age-related diseases at an early age, including
dementia, cardiovascular diseases, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
Scottish researchers have found that the later a person was born, the greater their risk of illness by
age 50. For example, those born between 1956 and 60 have higher disease scores than the 1951–55 or
1946–50 cohorts at the same age (Fig. 73).194

The key mechanisms underlying aging and cancer development share many common features. A
central factor in both processes is mitochondrial dysfunction — disruption of the cell organelles responsible
for energy production. With age, mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulate in human tissues,
and similar mutations have long been observed in various forms of cancer.195
When a mutation occurs in a cell, it can alter the cell’s behavior. For example, the mutated cell may
begin to grow and divide more rapidly, resist cell death even when it should occur, become “invisible” to
the immune system, or tolerate a lack of oxygen or nutrients more effectively.
Such mutated cells gain a competitive advantage over normal cells as they live longer, divide more
frequently, occupy increasing space, and eventually dominate surrounding tissues. Once these abnormal
cells accumulate in sufficient numbers, tumor growth may begin.

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Post-mitotic cells—such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and certain muscle cells—are particularly
vulnerable to mitochondrial damage. Because these cells do not divide, mutations accumulated over time,
especially those in mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 74), remain within the cell for its entire lifespan. Post-mitotic
cells are extremely metabolically active: neurons require substantial energy to transmit signals, and heart
cells continually pump blood. Consequently, their mitochondria function at maximum capacity, producing
large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These reactive oxygen species damage mitochondria,
triggering a cycle of increased ROS production and further damage. Over time, this cumulative damage
can initiate pathological processes such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cancer,
and even lead to death.
This mechanism might explain why cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks, strokes, and cancers
are the leading causes of death globally. Furthermore, the toxic impact of nanoplastics — which has
dramatically intensified over the past 10 to 20 years — likely explains why these diseases are occurring
at younger ages and have reached pandemic proportions, claiming tens of millions of lives annually.
Nanoplastics primarily disrupt mitochondrial function, promote oxidative stress, and induce mutations
in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.

Hormonal System Disruption Triggered by MNPs
Plastic manufacturing involves chemicals that interfere with endocrine system function and disrupt
hormonal balance. These chemicals can mimic, block, or alter the action of natural hormones, potentially
leading to various health issues.
Over 3,000 chemical substances used in packaging have been detected in the human body.196
Approximately 100 of those chemicals are classified as of high concern for human health.

Bisphenol A
Bisphenol A (BPA, C15H16O2) is a synthetic plasticizer that is widely used in polycarbonate
plastics (such as bottles and containers), epoxy resins (used for coating canned foods), and
medical devices.

When heated, BPA migrates into food and beverages.

“BPA is acting as a ‘rogue’ hormone to out-compete the natural hormone that is usually
involved in this pathway,” said Professor Ian Rae, an expert on environmental chemicals
from the School of Chemistry at the University of Melbourne (Fig. 75).197

Figure 75: Bisphenol A (BPA, C15H16O2) exerts endocrine-disrupting effects due to its structural similarity to the
hormone estrogen

More than 8 million tons of bisphenol A are produced worldwide and approximately 100 tons are
released into the atmosphere each year.198
Research shows that BPA and its substitute — bisphenol S (BPS) — disrupt the coordination of excitatory
and inhibitory signals in the nervous system.199 Both compounds induce similar pathological effects at
high concentrations (Fig. 76). Experiments with brain cells have revealed that even small amounts of BPA
or BPS, when exposed over a month, alter the chemical and electrical transmission of signals through
the synapses.200

In 2023, a study found a larger amount of bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates in children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to children without this condition.201
Researchers from the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne found that
boys were 6 times more likely to have a verified autism diagnosis by age 11 years than those whose
mothers had lower levels of BPA during pregnancy.202

“BPA can disrupt hormone controlled male fetal brain development in several ways,
including silencing a key enzyme, aromatase, that controls neurohormones and is especially
important in fetal male brain development,” said Professor Ponsonby.
“This appears to be part of the autism puzzle.”197

The suppression of the enzyme aromatase may explain the gender disparity in autism diagnoses: 4
to 5 boys for every one girl.203 While autism is less common in girls, they tend to experience more severe
forms of the condition.204
Bisphenol A (BPA) also contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes by causing hyperglycemia
and insulin resistance.205 Global mortality from diabetes continues to rise steadily (Fig. 77).

Phthalates
Phthalates are a group of chemical compounds primarily used as plasticizers, which are
substances that make plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), more flexible, softer, and
more durable.
Phthalates are widely used in industry and everyday life, but their ability to interfere with the endocrine
system raises concerns.206 Molecular formula (Fig. 78).
Phthalates are not hormones, but they can suppress the action of androgens (such as testosterone),
which is particularly critical for male development. Their exposure is associated with reduced sperm
motility and abnormalities in the development of reproductive organs (such as cryptorchidism in newborns).
Higher concentrations of phthalates have been found in men diagnosed with infertility.

Phthalates are not hormones themselves, but they can suppress the action of androgens (such as
testosterone), which is especially critical for male development. Exposure to phthalates has been linked to
reduced sperm motility and abnormalities in the development of reproductive organs (e.g., cryptorchidism
in newborns). Higher concentrations of phthalates have been found in men diagnosed with infertility.
In women, phthalates can disrupt the menstrual cycle and increase the risk of miscarriages and
preterm births. Fetal exposure to phthalates during pregnancy may lead to delayed brain development,
lower IQ, and behavioral problems in the offspring.207
Scientists have demonstrated a causal link between environmental phthalates (toxic chemicals found
in everyday consumer products) and the increased growth of uterine fibroids, the most common tumors
in women.208
Exposure to phthalates found in plastics increases the risk of childhood cancers by 20%, with a
threefold rise in cases of malignant bone tumors and a twofold increase in the incidence of lymphoma
and leukemia.209
A study involving over 5,000 American mothers found that phthalates are associated with the risk of
delivering low-birth-weight babies and preterm infants.210

The authors note that these factors moderately increase the likelihood of infant mortality and may
also impact children's academic performance, as well as raise the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and
mental disorders, such as autism and ADHD211 in children.
Chemical additives in plastics contribute to the development of obesity.212 According to data from the
World Health Organization (WHO), from 1990 to 2020, the global obesity rate among adults more than
doubled, while among adolescents, it increased fourfold.213 Obesity trends among adults and youth in

Electrostatic Charge of Nanoplastics
as a Key Driver of Their High Toxicity for the Human Body
The human body continuously generates bioelectric energy. All physiological processes, from heart
activity and sensory perception to higher cognitive functions, are driven by chemical reactions initiated
by the movement of electrical charges. Intracellular and extracellular fluids, which contain proteins,
are primarily composed of water with electropolar properties. Consequently, electrostatic interactions,
including hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic packing, play a crucial role in the formation of
protein structures necessary for their function and, as a result, for the maintenance of the organism's
vitality.214
Bioelectricity directly influences cell function through the interaction of ion channels and membrane
potentials. Each cell maintains a difference in electrical potential between its internal and external
environments — known as the resting membrane potential — achieved through the difference in ion
concentration inside and outside the cell (Fig. 81). The main types of ion channels present in the human
body include sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride channels. These channels, along with the
membrane potential, facilitate key functions of various cell types (Figs. 82–83).

Figure 81: Ion permeability and the action potential.
Changes in ion permeance underlying the action
potential. Electrical potential is graded at left in
millivolts, ion permeance at right in open channels
per square millimetre. At the resting potential, the
membrane potential is close to EK , the equilibrium
potential of K+. When sodium channels open, the
membrane depolarizes. When depolarization
reaches the threshold potential, it triggers an
action potential. Generation of the action potential
brings the membrane potential close to E Na ,
the equilibrium potential of Na+. When sodium
channels close (lowering Na+ permeance) and
potassium channels open (raising K+ permeance),
the membrane repolarizes.

In a myelinated axon, the myelin sheath prevents the local current (small black arrows) from flowing across the
membrane. This forces the current to travel down the nerve fibre to the unmyelinated nodes of Ranvier, which have
a high concentration of ion channels. Upon stimulation, these ion channels propagate the action potential (large
green arrows) to the next node. Thus, the action potential jumps along the fibre as it is regenerated at each node,
a process called saltatory conduction. In an unmyelinated axon, the action potential is propagated along the entire
membrane, fading as it diffuses back through the membrane to the original depolarized region.

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Bioelectricity generated within the human body—such as during muscle contractions or nerve signal
transmission—is entirely natural and harmless, as it is a fundamental part of physiological processes.
However, when micro- and nanoplastics enter the body, they carry with them an electrostatic charge
that they can retain for extended periods. It is this charge that poses a potential health risk by interfering
with vital biological functions.
Nanoplastics are plastic particles smaller than 1 micrometer. Due to their unique structure, they
can accumulate electrostatic charges, making them a growing concern for scientists. When micro- or
nanoplastic particles become electrified through the triboelectric effect (as a result of contact and
friction with other surfaces), they acquire either a positive or negative charge. This charge significantly
influences how these particles behave in both the human body and the environment.
The unique structure of nanoplastic particles allows them to adsorb pollutants, ions, and organic
molecules, which enhances their role as carriers of toxins in ecosystems.215, 216
The chemical composition of nanoplastics plays a key role in determining their electrostatic properties:
polymers such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), or polypropylene (PP) often contain functional
groups — carboxyl (-COOH), sulfate (-SO3H), or amino (-NH2) — that can become ionized depending on
environmental conditions. For example, a study published in the journal Langmuir showed that polystyrene
nanoparticles with carboxyl groups (PS-COOH) have a negative zeta potential, whereas those with amino
groups (PS-NH2) have a positive one — confirming the influence of functional groups on nanoplastic
charge.217
The process of charge accumulation is not limited to chemical properties alone. During manufacturing or
mechanical processes, such as friction, nanoplastics can become charged through contact electrification.
A study conducted on plastic containers revealed that polystyrene is capable of accumulating a charge
of up to –10 kV, which can be retained for an extended period and attracts oppositely charged particles
such as dust or bacterial spores.218 Moreover, variations in polymer structure — for example, the presence
of polar groups — allow nanoplastics to exhibit either positive or negative charge depending on the pH
of the environment. In acidic environments, amino groups may give particles a positive charge, while in
alkaline conditions, carboxyl groups dominate and impart a negative charge — findings that have been
confirmed in studies involving Arabidopsis thaliana plants.219

Thus, understanding the structure of nanoplastics and their electrostatic characteristics not only
reveals their physical nature, but also lays the foundation for analyzing how these particles can affect
ecosystems and living organisms. These topics will be explored further in the context of their pathogenic
mechanisms.
Thanks to their high dielectric permittivity (the ability to retain an electric charge), nanoplastics,
once inside the body, continue to accumulate harmful charges that under normal conditions would
be neutralized or dissipated through the body's natural conductive systems. This disrupts the body's
self-regulation processes, creating risks for cellular structures due to prolonged exposure to abnormal
electrostatic energy.
To grasp the scale of the threat posed by nanoplastics entering the body, we can turn once again to the
body's bioelectrical systems — complex mechanisms where electrical impulses serve as the language
of intercellular communication.
Every movement and thought is made possible by invisible signals delivering commands to cells.
Neurons exchange information via electrical impulses, muscles contract in response to these signals,
and the brain processes information through a combination of bioelectrical and chemical interactions.
Even breathing, reflexes, vision, and hearing depend on tiny electrical discharges that regulate the function
of organs.
These invisible currents, refined over millions of years of evolution, translate bioelectrical impulses
into the language of life. But their harmony is disrupted by foreign elements: microscopic particles of
nanoplastics.
Once inside the body, nanoplastics can adsorb ions and create zones of abnormal electrical conductivity,
disrupting the natural ionic balance and the processes of local charge neutralization regulated by intercellular
fluids. Ion adsorption on the surface of nanoplastics leads to the accumulation of electrostatic charge on
these particles. This phenomenon can trigger oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and interfere with electrochemical communication between cells, impairing their function.
This is confirmed by research220 showing that 100 nm polystyrene particles, even in the presence of
sodium ions (Na+), remained stable and adsorbed onto bacterial surfaces despite their negative charge.
For example, experiments with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated that
nanoplastics significantly alter the zeta potential of cells, making their surfaces more negatively charged
and thereby disrupting the natural electrostatic balance.

Charged nanoplastic particles can affect the electric fields surrounding cells, distorting signal
transmission. This is similar to interference in radio communication: instead of clear commands, there’s
chaotic noise that disrupts how cells exchange information. While direct effects on nerve cells were not
studied and conclusions about human impact remain preliminary and require further investigation, the
observed changes in bacterial surface charge suggest that nanoplastic can modify the electrochemical
properties of cell membranes. For instance, at concentrations above 64 micrograms per milliliter,
polystyrene particles cause significant shifts in zeta potential, which could potentially impair the function
of ion channels or receptors critical for intercellular communication.
The ability of nanoparticles to “stick” to surfaces, as shown in atomic force microscopy images in
the aforementioned study (Fig. 84), poses a risk of long-term exposure. Once embedded in tissues,
the particles can form persistent electrostatic anomalies that sodium and potassium ions cannot fully
neutralize, especially if nanoplastic penetrates inside cells, bypassing the protective mechanisms of
intercellular fluid.

The danger of the pathogenic charge accumulated on nanoplastics also lies in its ability to create
electrical interference around immune cells. This is confirmed by a study221 showing that positively
charged nanoplastics (PS-NH2) significantly reduce the viability of immune cells and the stability of
lysosomal membranes compared to negatively charged ones (PS-COOH), highlighting the critical role
of surface charge in their interactions with cells.
Electrostatically charged micro- and nanoplastic (MNP) particles demonstrate an increased ability
to adsorb onto cell membranes, tissues, and other biological surfaces—literally sticking to them. This
adhesion raises the risk of both mechanical and chemical damage to cells, disrupting their structure
and function.
Such charges may also facilitate the penetration of MNP particles through complex biological barriers
like the blood–brain barrier or the blood–placenta barrier. As a result, toxins may reach the brain or
developing fetus, increasing the risks of neurotoxic effects and fetal development disorders.
The electrostatic influence of nanoplastics may interfere with the structure and function of proteins, ion
channels, and cell receptors, which in turn disrupts cell signaling, triggers oxidative stress, and weakens
immune defense. These disruptions can initiate a cascade of pathological processes, including chronic
inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders, malignant tumor formation, and systemic dysfunction,
significantly raising the risk of severe diseases.
Thus, the accumulation of electrostatic charge on nanoplastics is not merely a physical phenomenon
— it is a mechanism that amplifies the danger of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). This is especially
critical given the fact that electrostatic charge can persist on MNPs for extended periods, and that these
particles are extremely resistant to elimination from the human body.
Studying this phenomenon is now of utmost importance, as it leads to a deeper understanding of
how pathogenic electrical charges accumulated on nanoplastics could evolve into a macroscopic threat
to the survival of the human species itself.
Until recently, it was believed that the foundation of cellular energy—proton transport—was governed
purely by chemistry: protons were thought to "hop" from one water molecule to another. However, a
new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences radically changes this view.
It turns out that proton transport in living organisms depends not only on chemical properties, but also
on quantum factors—specifically, the spin of electrons and the chirality of biological molecules (Fig. 85).

Due to the CISS effect this electric polarization is producing spin polarization. Preserving angular momentum
generates chiral phonons that enhance proton transfer.

122, e2500584122 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500584122

A study conducted by Israeli scientists at the Hebrew University revealed that in proteins such as
lysozyme, proton transfer significantly accelerates when electrons with the “right” spin are introduced
— and slows down when the spin is opposite. This is due to the fact that protons and electrons in living
systems operate as a coordinated quantum mechanism. Even minimal changes in their spin orientation
can influence fundamental biological processes — energy production, metabolism, and intracellular
regulation.

As noted by the study’s lead researcher, Naama Goren, “Our findings show that the way
protons move in biological systems isn't just about chemistry—it's also about quantum

Systemic Effects of MNPs on Human Organs and Functional Systems
Once micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) enter the human body, they circulate through the bloodstream,
reaching all organs and tissues (Fig. 86). Plastic particles have been detected in human blood, heart and
bone tissue, brain, placenta, lungs, liver, and other organs.223

Respiratory System Damage From Inhaled MNPs
One of the primary routes for MNPs to enter the human body is through inhalation. Research conducted
by Chinese scientists224 revealed that during two hours of active time spent outdoors, adults inhale
approximately 106,000 microplastic particles, while children inhale about 73,700.
Due to their thermodynamic properties, particles smaller than 0.1 micrometers can effectively deposit
throughout the respiratory tract, from the upper airways to the alveoli.225
The lungs have a vast alveolar surface area (approximately 150 m²) and a thin tissue barrier (less than
1 micrometer), enabling nanoplastics to easily enter the bloodstream (Fig. 87).
Microplastics were detected in 13 out of 20 human lung tissue samples.226
According to the study involving 22 patients with respiratory diseases, microplastics were found in
all sputum samples,228 ranging from 18.75 to 91.75 particles per 10 ml.229 A connection between allergic
rhinitis and microplastics has also been established.230
MNPs are closely linked to the onset and progression of various respiratory conditions, including
asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tumors.229 Research
revealed that 97% of malignant lung specimens contained microplastic fibers.231

Possible mechanisms include oxidative stress, inflammation, and disruption of the lung microbiome.
Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) can trigger pulmonary inflammation.232
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, lower respiratory tract infections remain the
deadliest infectious disease globally, ranking as the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Additionally,
deaths from tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancers have risen, now ranking as the sixth leading cause of
mortality.233

Neurotoxic Effects of MNPs:
Damage to the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
Research confirms that neurological disorders are the leading cause of physical and cognitive disability
worldwide, currently affecting approximately 3.4 billion people. The absolute number of patients has
significantly increased over the past 30 years.234 Moreover, the burden of chronic neurodegenerative
diseases is expected to at least double over the next two decades.
According to WHO data, one in eight people worldwide suffers from a mental health disorder.235
The prevalence of bipolar disorder among adolescents and young adults globally has risen from 79.21
per 100,000 people in 1990 to 84.97 per 100,000 in 2019.236 Over the past three decades, incidence rates
have increased for both men and women (Fig. 88).
Recent studies indicate a rise in mental health disorders among children and adolescents. According
to the 2022 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report, from 2016 to 2019, the rates of emergency
department (ED) visits with a principal diagnosis related to mental health only increased for ages 0-17
years, from 784.1 to 869.3 per 100,000 population. Additionally, from 2008 to 2020, the rates of death from
suicide among people age 12 and over increased 16% overall, from 14.0 to 16.3 per 100,000 population.237
A report from the health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield reveals that diagnoses of clinical
depression, also known as major depression, have risen by 33% since 2013. “Some of the literature is
already starting to predict that by 2030, depression will be the number-one cause for loss of longevity
or life. The report notes that women and men with depression may on average lose up to 9.6 years of
healthy life.238

Trends in the rise of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders clearly correlate with the
increasing presence of plastics in the environment (Fig. 96-97).
The highest concentrations of nanoplastics were found in human brain tissue — 7 to 30 times higher
than in the liver or kidneys. Brain tissue samples from individuals diagnosed with dementia showed even
greater MNP presence — up to 10 times higher — compared to brain tissue from individuals without
dementia (Fig. 91).241 The predominant particles in the brain were tiny polyethylene fragments or flakes,
one of the most commonly used plastics in packaging.

New data confirm that from 2016 to 2024, over eight years, the amount of plastic in the human brain
has increased by 50%.241

“The concentrations we saw in the brain tissue of normal individuals, who had an
average age of around 45 or 50 years old, were 4,800 micrograms per gram. (...) That’s
the equivalent of an entire standard plastic spoon. That would mean that our brains today
are 99.5% brain and the rest is plastic.” said co-lead study author Matthew Campen from
the University of New Mexico.242

Given the rising levels of plastic particles in the atmosphere, water, and food, it is certain that the
amount of nanoplastics in our bodies will continue to grow. If this trend persists, the plastic content in
the brain could increase by another 50% within the next four years.
Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) enter the brain through the bloodstream, crossing the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), and via inhalation through the olfactory nerves (Fig. 92).

The blood-brain barrier is a specialized physiological system that regulates the transfer of
substances from the bloodstream to the central nervous system (Fig. 93). It selectively allows
nutrients and oxygen to pass while blocking toxins and pathogens (Fig. 94). This mechanism
provides critical protection for the brain, maintaining the homeostasis of the neuronal environment.

Due to their submicron size and physicochemical properties, plastic nanoparticles can penetrate the
brain within just two hours of entering the body.243
When inhaled, plastic nanoparticles travel through the olfactory nerves directly to the brain region
responsible for processing odors (Fig. 95).244 As a result, they take a shorter and more direct route to
the brain than to other organs.

Figure 95: Penetration of nanoplastics (NPs) through olfactory nerves into the brain

Once nanoplastics penetrate the brain, they disrupt the function of brain cells — neurons. Research
has shown that the surface properties and electric charge of nanoparticles significantly affect their
interaction with neurons and the transmission of nerve impulses.
The electrostatic charge of nanoplastics allows them to freely interfere with the function of every
cell in the human body, penetrating cells, causing oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, impairing
mitochondrial function, and potentially leading to mitochondrial destruction and cell death.
The study245 has demonstrated that negatively charged nanoparticles can induce depolarization of
neuronal membranes, altering their electrical activity.

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Experiments revealed that negatively charged nanoplastic particles selectively bind to neurons actively
involved in nerve impulse transmission. These particles adhere to neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and
synaptic clefts, while glial cells, which lack electrical activity, do not interact with them.
Thus, the electrical activity of neurons serves as the primary trigger for the binding of negatively
charged nanoplastics to cell membranes.
Research indicates that micro- and nanoplastics tend to accumulate in the lipid-rich myelin sheath
of the brain, which surrounds neurons and facilitates nerve signal conduction.246 Nanoplastics trigger
the degradation of the myelin sheath around axons, 247, 248 disrupting the transmission of nerve impulses
between neurons.

Impact of Nanoplastics on Neurons
The effects of nanoplastics on neurons can occur through the following mechanisms:
1. Influence on Neuronal Membrane Potential
Neurons function due to a membrane potential difference (approximately -70 mV at rest), maintained
by ion gradients (Na+, K+, Cl-, etc.) and the activity of ion channels. When a charged nanoplastic particle
is near a neuronal membrane, it can alter the electric field and destabilize the membrane potential. This
may lead to depolarization or hyperpolarization, and in severe cases, spontaneous neuronal activation
or signal blockage.
2. Electrostatic Interaction with Ion Channels
Ion channels in neuronal membranes contain charged amino acids, particularly in the channel’s “gate”
regions. A nanoplastic particle with a strong negative or positive charge can electrostatically interact with
these sites, altering the channel’s configuration. This may cause channel blockage or improper activation,
disrupting normal neuronal function.
3. Disruption of Synaptic Function
Synapses rely on the precise activity of Ca² +, Na+ ions, and neurotransmitters.249 Electrostatically
charged nanoplastic particles can interfere with neurotransmitter release or generate false signals,
potentially disrupting the transmission of nerve impulses.

4. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation
Charged nanoplastics can increase levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress in neurons occurs when reactive oxygen species exceed the cell’s ability to neutralize
them. This damages DNA, cellular structures such as membranes, proteins, and mitochondria, impairing
normal neuronal function. As a result, the cell loses its ability to effectively transmit nerve impulses,
leading to degradation and, ultimately, cell death. Since neurons have limited regenerative capacity,
damage caused by oxidative stress is often irreversible and can contribute to progressive declines in
memory, attention, and other cognitive functions.
5. Impact on Mitochondrial Function
Nanoplastics with a positive electrostatic charge can penetrate cells and accumulate in mitochondria,
disrupting their membrane potential. This impairs the respiratory chain, causing electron leaks that react
with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide anions. Their excessive accumulation
amplifies oxidative stress and may damage cellular structures.
6. Mitochondrial Mutations
Nanoplastic particles can damage mitochondrial DNA, disrupting normal mitochondrial function. This
affects critical cellular processes, including energy production, oxidative stress regulation, programmed cell
death, and metabolism. Disruptions in these systems can create conditions that promote the development
of diseases.
7. Reactive Properties of Nanoplastic Surfaces
The high specific surface area of nanoplastics is a key factor driving their elevated chemical reactivity
and ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Compared to microplastics, nanoparticles have a surface
area per unit mass that is tens or even hundreds of times larger, significantly enhancing their interactions
with biomolecules and the surrounding environment.
The electrostatic charge on plastic particles can disrupt neuronal function by blocking or distorting
the transmission of nerve impulses. This leads to malfunctions in the nervous system and can trigger
a wide range of pathological conditions in the body. These effects manifest as various neurological,
autonomic, cognitive, and psychiatric disorders (Table 2).

disorders, epilepsy, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, depression, anxiety and cognitive disorders,

Micro- and Nanoplastics as a Risk Factor for Autism Spectrum Disorders
Alongside the rise in environmental plastic pollution, there has been an increase in the prevalence of

According to the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network, 1 in 36
children in the United States was diagnosed with ASD in 2020, reflecting a 317 % increase in cases since
2000.250, 251
The human nervous system develops from the embryonic stage and through early childhood. Studies
suggest a potential link between exposure to micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) and the development of
ASD. Experimental data from Korean researchers demonstrate that prenatal and postnatal exposure to
MNPs may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.252
A study on the molecular effects of polystyrene nanoplastics on human neural stem cells showed
that nanoplastic exposure can lead to tissue damage and neurodevelopmental diseases.253
Research on rodents254 revealed that maternal exposure to micro- and nanoplastics during pregnancy
and lactation can impair hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring and reduce the volume of brain structures,
including the motor cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and olfactory bulb.
It is well established that alterations in the structure and function of neural tissue proteins play a critical
role in the development of numerous disorders, including autism.255
Recent studies indicate that nanoplastics interact with proteins primarily via weak interactions, such
as hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals attraction forces, and electrostatic forces.256
These interactions cause structural deformations in protein molecules, disrupting their functionality. Given
the role of proteins in forming neural networks and synaptic transmission, such changes may contribute
to the development of ASD.

Role of MNPs in the Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Diseases
Plastic particles not only circulate in the bloodstream but can also settle on vascular walls, triggering a
cascade of pathological changes. Particularly concerning is the detection of microplastics in atherosclerotic
plaques.257 A recent study found that patients with microplastics in their carotid arteries had a 4.5 times
higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. This indicates that plastic fragments actively contribute
to the formation and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, promoting their rupture and thrombus
formation.258 MNPs also impair the integrity of the endothelium, the critical layer of cells lining the inner
surface of blood vessels, which regulates vascular tone, prevents thrombus formation, and mitigates
inflammatory responses.
Endothelial damage caused by plastic particles leads to chronic inflammation and an increased risk
of thrombosis, which is especially dangerous in arteries supplying the heart and brain.259 Microplastics
interact with blood components, such as platelets and red blood cells, promoting platelet aggregation and
initiating clot formation. Additionally, the surface of microplastics can cause mechanical damage to cells
and activate blood clotting cascades, potentially leading to chronic hypercoagulation and microvascular
disorders over time.
Immune cells can engulf microplastic particles but lack the mechanisms to fully break them down,
resulting in cell deformation and increased size. The accumulation of these altered cells in the small
vessels of the brain contributes to microthrombus formation, impairing cerebral blood flow and elevating
the risk of stroke, including in younger individuals.260
Chronic reduction in oxygen supply to the brain (hypoxia) leads to neuronal death and the development
of neurodegenerative changes, including brain tissue atrophy.261 Prolonged exposure to these processes
may reduce the volume of specific brain structures.
Due to their electrostatic charge, MNPs actively interact with cellular membranes, disrupting their
electrical potential. This, in turn, affects vascular contractility, signal transmission in myocytes, and heart
rhythm.
Mortality from cardiovascular diseases continues to rise steadily worldwide (Fig. 98). Particular attention
should be given to sudden cardiac death syndrome among young adults aged 25–44262 (Fig. 99), which
is recognized as a leading cause of death in the United States. Over the past two decades, the number
of cases has surged dramatically. Given the widespread presence of MNPs, their potential role in these
tragic events cannot be ruled out.

Another critical issue is the rise in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In the United States alone, the
rate of SIDS increased by 15% from 2019 to 2020, moving from the fourth to the third leading cause of
infant mortality.263 While the exact causes of SIDS remain unclear, many scientists suggest that factors
disrupting the regulation of heart rhythm and vascular tone in infants may play a key role. Nanoplastics,
capable of crossing the placenta and accumulating in the tissues of a developing fetus, are considered
a likely risk factor. Increasingly, researchers are converging on the view that nanoplastics may be a key
candidate for the role of an “invisible killer.”

The heart, one of the body’s most energy-demanding organs, critically depends on the efficient
functioning of mitochondria to supply its energy needs. Exposure to microplastic particles disrupts
mitochondrial processes, potentially leading to energy deficits in the myocardium and, consequently,
impaired cardiac function.

Gastrointestinal Dysfunction Due to MNP Exposure
The gut is the body’s largest immune organ, housing approximately 70% of all immune cells, around
500 million neurons, and over 100 trillion microorganisms.264 The gut microbiota plays a vital role in
maintaining immune health, and its imbalance can weaken immunity and contribute to various diseases.
Often referred to as the “second brain” due to its dense neural network and ability to communicate with
the central nervous system,265 the gut engages in complex biochemical signaling with the brain through
the “gut–brain axis,” which significantly influences both physical and psycho-emotional health (Fig. 100).

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

A healthy gut barrier prevents microbes and foreign particles from passing from the gut lumen into the
bloodstream.265 Micro- and nanoplastics compromise this barrier, increasing intestinal wall permeability. This leads
to inflammation in the gut and other organs, weakening immunity. Simultaneously, MNPs alter the composition
of the gut microbiota, causing an imbalance between beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms.266 This disrupts
digestion, reduces the body’s ability to break down food allergens, and heightens the risk of food allergies.267
This creates a vicious cycle: plastic disrupts the gut microbiota, increases inflammation, and compromises
the integrity of the intestinal wall. As a result, toxins, bacteria, and plastic particles begin to enter the bloodstream.
Their presence in the blood triggers an immune response that leads to chronic inflammation throughout the
body. From the bloodstream, these toxins, bacteria, and nanoplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach
the brain, where they provoke inflammatory reactions. In turn, these processes further impair immune response,
heighten the body’s stress response, and may negatively affect the gut microbiota through neuroendocrine
mechanisms—thus closing the vicious cycle along the “gut–brain” axis. Disruption of the interaction between
the gut microbiome and the central nervous system is directly linked to neurological disorders. For instance,
children with autism spectrum disorders exhibit significant microbiota imbalances, confirmed by microbiological
analysis and assessments of digestive system function.268
Studies of patients with inflammatory bowel disease show a positive correlation between disease severity
and microplastic concentration in feces. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have higher microplastic
levels (41.8 particles/g) compared to healthy individuals (28.0 particles/g). Additionally, significant microplastic
accumulation was observed in ulcerative lesions of the rectal mucosa in these patients.269 Furthermore,
microplastics remaining in the gut continue to exert harmful effects long after their initial entry into the body.

Impacts of MNPs on the Immune System
MNPs disrupt the immune response in the body, creating conditions conducive to the proliferation of
pathogens. Charged MNPs attract other molecules more easily—such as toxins, heavy metal salts, bacteria,
and viruses (see Fig. 101). This makes them a kind of “transport platform” for toxic compounds, amplifying
the biological activity and toxicity of these substances. The electrostatic charge on nanoplastics also acts
like an energy source or “battery,” helping viruses and bacteria stay viable for longer periods.
In addition, charged micro- and nanoplastic particles can remain suspended in water and air for extended
periods. They rise more easily into aerosols and enter the respiratory system, increasing the likelihood of their
absorption into the human body.

The cumulative effects of MNP on the microbiome, pathogens, and the immune system pose complex
health risks. Immune cells that come into contact with microplastics die approximately three times faster
than those that do not encounter them.270

Microplastic particles are capable of adsorbing viruses onto their surfaces due to electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions, thereby extending their viability.271 Viruses on the surface of microplastics
can remain active for up to three days — sufficient time to travel from wastewater treatment facilities
to beaches, for example.272 Microplastics facilitate the spread of pathogens and may contribute to their
genetic recombination. Research has shown that plastic particles not only impair the effectiveness of
medications but can also induce the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.273 Charged
particles of micro- and nanoplastics serve as platforms for the colonization of microorganisms.274
Bacteria and fungi, utilizing the electrostatic fields of nanoplastics, exhibit accelerated growth. Research
on daphnia has shown that exposure to nanoplastics induces oxidative stress and increases the incidence
of fungal infections by a factor of 11 (specifically the species Metschnikowia).275 This aligns with the
global expansion of the range and resistance of fungal diseases, which the WHO has identified as an
increasing threat to public health.
“Emerging from the shadows of the bacterial antimicrobial resistance pandemic,
fungal infections are growing, and are ever more resistant to treatments, becoming a
public health concern worldwide” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Assistant Director-General,
Antimicrobial Resistance.276

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE

Fungal metabolites released in the presence of micro- and nanoplastics are associated with tumor
growth 277 and chronic inflammation. Fungal DNA has been detected in specific types of cancer, indicating
a potential role for micro- and nanoplastics in carcinogenesis.278

Carcinogenic Properties of MNPs:
Mutation Pathways and Metastatic Progression
As mentioned in previous sections of this report, micro- and nanoplastics are significant factors in the
development of malignant tumors, given their negative impact at both the cellular and systemic levels.
Research indicates that microplastics and nanoplastics may act as hidden catalysts for tumor
progression, particularly through enhancing cell migration and fueling metastasis.279 It has also been
found that MNP particles can persist within cells for extended periods and be passed on to daughter
cells during division.
Currently, the mortality rate from oncological diseases continues to rise globally (Fig. 102).
It is projected that by 2050, the number of new cancer cases will increase by 77%.280

Effects of MNPs on Calcium Metabolism and Bone Structure
Plastic particles can infiltrate even the musculoskeletal system — the foundation of human physical
function (Fig. 103). In a realm where a precise balance exists between destruction and construction,
where bones are renewed daily, joints mitigate friction, and muscles support movement and warmth,
microplastics — partly due to their electrostatic charge — can substitute for building molecules and
initiate slow, destructive processes.
Research shows that microplastics can penetrate bone tissue, where their molecular structure allows
them to mimic calcium and other minerals essential for bone metabolism. As a result, plastic may be
mistakenly perceived by the body as a building material for bones. The body literally begins to “build”
bones from plastic.
This disruption in molecular recognition is associated with a range of negative consequences:
microplastics can impair the functions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, disrupt calcium and phosphorus
metabolism, thereby contributing to the development of osteoporosis. Inflammatory cascades are
triggered, gene expression is altered, and bone tissue loses density and strength. Additionally, the presence
of nanoplastics may cause chronic inflammation, damaging joint cartilage and bone tissue, which is
linked to an increased risk of osteoarthritis, pain syndromes, and stiffness in movement.281, 282

Research on rodents has demonstrated that the number of osteoblasts significantly decreased in
mice exposed to polystyrene microplastics.280
Plastic poses a considerable threat to skeletal muscle as well. Studies show that nanoplastics can
infiltrate muscle cells, disrupting mitochondrial function. This leads to an energy deficit, activates aggressive
forms of reactive oxygen species, accelerates cellular aging, impairs muscle recovery after exertion, and
contributes to muscle atrophy. Older adults and patients with chronic illnesses are particularly vulnerable.
Micro- and nanoplastics accumulate in bone marrow,283 disrupting the formation of stem cells (both
hematopoietic and mesenchymal),284 from which red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, osteocytes,
chondrocytes, and adipocytes are derived. Their dysfunction results in systemic damage to the body.

Reproductive Disorders Associated With MNP Exposure:
Infertility and Erectile Dysfunction
Declining Fertility
Predictions indicate that by 2045, the world may become completely infertile.285
As early as 2018, a group of leading physicians and scientists at the XIII International Symposium
on Spermatology in Stockholm urged governments to recognize the decline in male fertility as a serious
public health issue and to acknowledge the importance of male reproductive health for the survival of
the human species.286
Contrary to popular belief, reproductive health is not solely determined by hormonal balance, genetics,
and lifestyle. An increasing number of scientific studies point to the critical role of mitochondria in the
processes of conception and embryo development. These tiny organelles, responsible for producing the
energy necessary for all life processes, play a crucial role in fertility for both men and women, and their
significance for human reproductive function is proving to be much deeper than previously understood.
Dysfunctions in mitochondrial activity can be a cause of infertility in both women and men. In men,
mitochondria located in the tail of sperm are responsible for the motility necessary for fertilization.
Malfunctions in their operation reduce sperm motility and can lead to abnormalities.

Studies conducted by Chinese scientists have found microplastics in all sperm samples, averaging two
particles measuring up to 7 micrometers, most commonly polystyrene.287 The presence of microplastics is
associated with morphological abnormalities in sperm and shortened telomeres. Due to their microscopic
size and charge, nanoplastics can cross the blood-testis barrier and infiltrate the reproductive organs,
disrupting their functions. Particular concern is raised by the observed trend of a 62.3% decline in the
overall sperm count in men from 1973 to 2018288 (Fig. 104).

While many factors influence fertility, an increasing number of scientists are leaning toward the view that
chemical compounds found in plastics play a key role in this process. Phthalates, used to make plastics
flexible, disrupt hormonal balance, reduce libido, and may contribute to premature sexual maturation
and testicular dysfunction.
The situation regarding female fertility is equally concerning. A 2025 study found microplastic particles
in the follicular fluid of the ovaries in 14 out of 18 women, averaging over 2,000 particles per milliliter,
most of which were less than 5 micrometers in diameter289 (Fig. 105).

These data indicate the ability of plastic particles to cross the hematofollicular barrier in the ovaries. At
the cellular level, micro- and nanoplastics can damage DNA, disrupt cell division, and induce inflammation.
Their interference with hormonal regulation, impairment of placental functions, influence on angiogenesis,
and association with the development of uterine fibroids have been demonstrated.

Erectile Dysfunction
Results from a national study in Japan revealed a decline in erectile function and sexual activity among
younger generations.290 Assessment based on the Erection Hardness Score (EHS) identified a 30.9%
prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED), affecting approximately 14 million men. Sexual desire, erection
rigidity, orgasms, and satisfaction were lower than expected among young Japanese men, particularly
those aged 20–24, though these factors tended to worsen with age. Notably, the prevalence rate in the
20–24 age group was 26.6%, nearly equivalent to that of the 50–54 age group (27.8%) (Fig. 106, 107).

123

Additionally, a separate global study reported that three out of four men experience symptoms of ED,
indicating that the condition is not rare and may affect men of any age.
Japan’s first official national survey on sexual function, conducted in 1998, estimated approximately
11.3 million men with moderate to complete ED. Additionally, national surveys on male infertility in Japan,
conducted in 1996 and 2015, revealed striking data. In the 2015 study, 13.5% of men faced male infertility
due to ED as the primary cause, nearly four times higher than in 1996.
The collective body of current scientific evidence suggests that micro- and nanoplastics in the body
are a hidden but significant cause of declining reproductive health. These particles infiltrate reproductive
organs, impair mitochondrial function, cause inflammation, disrupt hormonal balance, and damage DNA,
reducing sperm motility and morphological quality. Their presence in semen and follicular fluid indicates
their ability to cross biological barriers and exert profound systemic effects. This poses a threat not only
to individual health but also to the future reproductive capacity of humanity as a whole.

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

MNP Penetration Through the Placental Barrier
and Its Effects on the Developing Body
Prenatal Exposure to Micro- and Nanoplastics on the Fetus
Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the effects of microplastics.291 Plastic particles that enter
the mother’s body can cross the placenta, interfering with the secretion of hormones that regulate pregnancy
and increasing the risk of preterm birth, miscarriage, and fetal developmental disorders (Fig. 108). In 2020,
an estimated 13.4 million children (1 in 10) were born preterm (<37 weeks), making it a leading cause of
infant mortality. Surviving preterm infants face a higher risk of serious illnesses and chronic conditions.292
The developing endocrine system of children is highly sensitive to chemicals in plastics, which can
mimic or block hormones293 (Fig. 109). Exposure to infants can even occur through breast milk. Additionally,
nanoplastics may have delayed effects, disrupting the formation of reproductive cells during childhood and
adolescence, potentially reducing fertility in adulthood.
The blood–placenta barrier (BPB) plays a critical role in regulating the exchange of substances between
mother and fetus, protecting the fetus from harmful agents. However, studies show that micro- and
nanoplastics can penetrate BPB. In 2020, a study led by Antonio Ragusa using Raman microspectroscopy
(a method that analyzes light scattering to determine the chemical composition of materials) detected
microplastics in the placentas of four out of six women with normal pregnancies. The samples contained
12 particles ranging 5–10 μm, including polypropylene and pigments used in cosmetics, paints, adhesives,
and hygiene products.294

A study conducted by the University of New Mexico found that the concentration of micro- and
nanoplastics in the placentas of preterm infants is higher than in those of full-term infants. Analysis of
158 placentas using mass spectrometry revealed that women who gave birth prematurely had greater
accumulation of plastic particles.295

“Nanoparticles apparently have an indirect effect on the child in the womb by inhibiting
the formation of blood vessels via messenger substances,” said biologist Tina Bürki.296

Nanometer-sized polystyrene particles can cause brain developmental disorders, especially cognitive
deficits.297 According to research, exposure to microplastics during pregnancy and the first few months
of life may result in permanent alterations to the reproductive axis and central nervous system in the
offspring of different species.298

Postnatal Exposure to Micro- and Nanoplastics in Infants
Newborns face continuous exposure to micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) from the environment. A
2020 study299 found that infants can ingest up to 4.5 million plastic particles per day solely from feeding
with polypropylene bottles, which constitute the majority of baby bottles used worldwide.
Infants may also ingest microplastics through breast milk. In 2022, an analysis of breast milk from
34 healthy women detected microplastics in 76% of the samples300(Fig. 110). MNPs can have delayed
effects, disrupting the development of reproductive cells during childhood and adolescence, which can
reduce fertility in adulthood.Additional data show that MNP levels in infant feces are 14 times higher
than in adults.301
Nanoplastics and associated chemicals disrupt the molecular structure and functionality of breast
milk. These compounds can alter proteins in human breast milk and infant formulas, potentially leading
to developmental issues later in life.302, 303

High concentrations of MNPs exert a cumulative toxic effect on the developing body. Nanoplastics,
by penetrating cells, can cause structural DNA damage and disrupt metabolic processes. These effects
increase the risk of genetic mutations and long-term pathologies, posing a threat to the health of future
generations.

Effects of MNP Exposure and Its Link to Congenital Abnormalities
Beyond its ability to infiltrate tissues and cells, micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) possess another
dangerous characteristic: they can be “inherited” by future generations. During cell division, fragments
of MNPs are transferred from one cell to another. Due to their minuscule size and electrostatic charge,
these particles can easily cross the blood–placenta barrier and enter fetal tissues and cells, exerting
harmful effects on the developing organism. As emphasized throughout this report, one of the primary
consequences of micro- and nanoplastic exposure is mitochondrial dysfunction.
A recent Mendelian randomized study has provided compelling evidence of a causal link between the
expression of mitochondrial proteins and the risk of congenital anomalies. The study used genetic variants
as instrumental variables to reduce the biases typically associated with observational data. Among 66
mitochondrial protein traits examined, significant associations were found with developmental defects of
the heart, ear, nervous system, genitourinary system, and limbs. These findings support the hypothesis
that mitochondrial activity plays a critical role in embryonic morphogenesis.304
Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whether inherited or occurring de novo, are responsible for
a wide range of clinical syndromes including MELAS, MERRF, NARP, Leigh Syndrome, and others. These
mutations primarily affect organs with high energy demands—such as the heart, brain, muscles, and
eyes. Transmission occurs exclusively through the maternal line due to the mitochondrial origin of the
oocyte (Fig. 111). These disorders often manifest early in life and are characterized by severe neurological
and metabolic impairments.
Children with mitochondrial disorders often face developmental delays, muscle weakness, cognitive
impairments, and coordination issues. Conditions such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Barth syndrome,
Alpers’ disease, and others can lead to severe outcomes, including disability or even death.
Over the past two decades, physicians have reported a concerning rise in congenital birth defects
among newborns. In China alone, the incidence nearly tripled—from 99.15 per 10,000 births in 2005 to
290.27 per 10,000 in 2022 (Fig. 112).305 Similar trends have been observed in other countries as well.
While this surge is driven by multiple factors, a growing body of scientific evidence points to a new and
rapidly escalating threat: microplastics, and especially nanoplastics, which are capable of penetrating
embryonic tissues and interfering with the formation of organs and biological systems.

During the production of primary oocytes, a selected number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules are
transferred into each oocyte. Oocyte maturation is associated with the rapid replication of this mtDNA population.
This restriction-amplification event can lead to a random shift of mtDNA mutational load between generations
and is responsible for the variable levels of mutated mtDNA observed in affected offspring from mothers with
pathogenic mtDNA mutations. Mitochondria that contain mutated mtDNA are shown in red, those with normal
mtDNA are shown in green.

The electrostatic charge carried by nanoplastics poses a particular threat to embryonic tissues, where
even a single error can result in a developmental abnormality. These particles exhibit increased adhesion
to cell surfaces, including neural crest cells — key players in the formation of the heart, blood vessels,
and craniofacial structures. In experimental studies on chicken embryos, nanoplastics induced severe
defects, including malformations of the heart and major vessels. One of the most rapidly increasing
abnormalities is gastroschisis — a developmental defect of the anterior abdominal wall in which fetal
organs protrude outside the body through an opening in the skin and muscle (Figs. 113, 114, 115).
According to international data, the prevalence of this condition has risen by 161% over the past three
decades, with rates among mothers under the age of 20 increased severalfold.306 It is hypothesized that
nanoplastics interfere with abdominal wall development during early pregnancy (weeks 4–8), triggering
inflammation and disrupting the closure of the ventral body wall.

Another condition—hypospadias, a congenital defect in which the urethra in boys opens in an abnormal
location307—has also shown a steady increase (Fig. 116, 117, 118). For example, in the United States, from
1997 to 2018, the incidence of hypospadias increased by approximately 1.06 cases per 1,000 live male
births (from 6.1 to 7.16 per 1,000), representing a roughly 17% rise.308 Studies using animal models have
shown that exposure to phthalates—chemicals commonly found in microplastics—disrupts testosterone
synthesis in male fetuses.

Figure 116-118: Hypospadias

These substances, anchored to the charged surface of nanoplastics, are easily transported into
the bloodstream and placenta, amplifying hormonal disruptions during critical periods of sexual
differentiation. Against this backdrop, there has been an increase in the incidence of Down syndrome,
trisomy, atrioventricular heart defects, and other serious conditions, rising from 12.78 per 10,000 live
births in 1999–2001 to 15.55 per 10,000 in 2016–2020.309
Concurrently, there is a rise in neuropsychiatric issues among children, including anxiety disorders
and cognitive deficits. While a direct causal link with microplastics is still under investigation, known
mechanisms — such as inflammation, epigenetic modulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction — provide
grounds to suspect microplastics as a contributing factor.307, 310

Conclusions and Prospects.
Is It Possible to Reduce the Impact of MNPs on Human Health?
The analysis of aggregated data demonstrates that micro- and nanoplastics represent a significant
and underestimated risk factor for human health. Current scientific evidence strongly indicates that MNPs
are an integral part of the global toxic burden on the human body. Due to their ability to cross biological
barriers and accumulate in various tissues — including the brain, heart, lungs, and placenta — MNPs
exert toxic effects at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels. In combination with chemical additives
and environmental pollutants adsorbed onto their surfaces, plastic particles act as triggers for chronic
inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA mutations — processes underlying
a wide range of diseases, including neurodegenerative, oncological, cardiovascular, endocrine, and
autoimmune disorders. Particularly alarming is the fact that MNP particles are virtually non-excretable,
accumulating in the body with age and intensifying their cumulative impact.
Current evidence confirms that avoiding exposure to MNPs is virtually impossible: they are present in
the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and even within the cells of animals and plants
we consume. As a result, human exposure to plastic particles is both ubiquitous and continuous, from
prenatal development through the final stages of life. Inhalation is particularly concerning, as nanoparticles
can bypass the blood–brain barrier and accumulate directly in brain tissue, making the central nervous
system one of the most vulnerable targets.
An additional biological risk stems from the electrostatic activity of MNPs, which enhances their
interaction with biological structures and disrupts cellular homeostasis. Moreover, MNPs may act as
carriers for pathogens and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, giving plastic pollution a distinctly
interdisciplinary dimension — one that intersects ecology, toxicology, immunology, neurology, and
reproductive medicine.
In this regard, one of the strategic directions proposed by ALLATRA as part of a broader effort to
counter the threat of MNPs is the development of methods to neutralize or shield the electrostatic
charge of nanoplastics. Reducing the electrostatic activity of such particles could significantly lower
their harmful effects and slow their accumulation in the body. According to the authors of this report,
charge shielding or neutralization methods may reduce the potential risks associated with MNPs by at
least 50 %. This could provide crucial time to develop more comprehensive strategies for diagnosing,
preventing, and removing MNPs from the body. In this context, further research in the fields of biophysics,
nanotechnology, and molecular toxicology becomes especially important.
Despite the growing number of scientific publications on this topic, the impact of MNPs on human
health remains poorly understood and insufficiently considered in the development of public health and
environmental protection strategies. Given the scale of plastic pollution, the biological activity of these
particles, and the potentially irreversible consequences of their effects, this area demands urgent attention
from the scientific community and health authorities. It also calls for the systematization of existing data,
the development of standardized risk assessment frameworks, and the expansion of intergovernmental
and international scientific collaboration.

ANALYSIS OF MODERN STRATEGIES
FOR REDUCING PLASTIC POLLUTION

Technologies for Removing Large Plastic Debris
From Aquatic Ecosystems
Mitigation efforts aimed to address ocean pollution have primarily focused on removing visible, large
debris from the water's surface. One of the most ambitious projects to date is The Ocean Cleanup initiative,
which targets the collection of plastics and other types of floating waste. Its floating systems capture
surface-level debris (Fig. 119), which is then sorted and prepared for recycling or disposal.

Figure 119: The image shows the Ocean Cleanup technology in action. A long, U-shaped floating barrier made of

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

133

While this method shows promise, several critical issues must be considered:
1. The debris collection process is not selective, meaning that along with plastic waste, living
organisms — such as microscopic algae, fish larvae, and jellyfish — may also be captured. Currently,
there are no quantitative assessments of the volume of bycatch, but the potential large-scale removal of
these organisms could have harmful consequences for marine ecosystems by disrupting natural food
chains. Despite measures aimed at protecting marine life, the issue remains unresolved.
2. Activists are genuinely committed to cleaning the ocean, yet the current efforts remain insufficient
to yield meaningful results.
As of November 2024, The Ocean Cleanup initiative has removed approximately 20,000 tons of plastic
waste from the world’s oceans. This is undoubtedly a noteworthy achievement. However, against a
backdrop of the global crisis, it accounts for only 0.01% of the estimated 200 million tons of plastic
currently polluting the ocean. Furthermore, it is important to factor in the ongoing influx of new waste,
which amounts to approximately 11 million tons annually (Fig. 120). These figures underscore the vast
disproportion between cleanup efforts and the scale of the problem.
3. The key issue remains the fate of the collected plastic. Current global recycling rates for plastic
waste do not exceed 9 % (Fig. 121). As a result, there is a strong likelihood that a significant portion of
the recovered plastic will end up in landfills, which fails to address pollution over the long term.

Figure 120: The chart compares three key metrics related to plastic pollution in the oceans: the estimated mass of
floating plastic debris, the annual input of plastic into the ocean, and the quantity collected by The Ocean Cleanup.

Moreover, ocean cleanup operations involve significant financial costs. For example, the remoteness
of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is located far from the territorial waters of any country, creating a
situation where no single nation is clearly responsible for funding or carrying out cleanup efforts. According
to Charles Moore — an oceanographer and researcher who first discovered the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch — a full-scale cleanup of the patch would “bankrupt any country” that attempts such an effort. It is
also important to note that five similar garbage patches have been identified across the world’s oceans
(Fig. 122), further exacerbating the problem.

Figure 122: Schematic illustration showing the locations of the five major garbage patches in the world’s oceans

It is important to note that large visible debris is only a part of the broader issue of plastic pollution in
the ocean. According to marine biologist Melanie Bergmann of the Alfred Wegener Institute, “This only
refers to the plastic on the ocean's surface, which represents just a small portion — less than 1 % of
what is actually in the ocean.”

136

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

As plastic breaks down into micro- and nanoplastics, the task of cleaning the ocean of this type
of pollution becomes significantly more challenging. Some experimental technologies for removing
microplastics from the water already exist. For example, researchers at Sichuan University have created a
tiny robo-fish (Fig. 123) capable of swimming in aquatic environments and adsorbing nearby free-floating
bits of microplastics.311 This 13 millimeters long bionic robot effectively collects microplastics thanks
to strong chemical bonds and electrostatic interactions between the materials of its body and the
microplastic components, such as organic dyes, antibiotics, and heavy metals.

Figure 123: The image shows a tiny robotic fish created by researchers at Sichuan University. This compact device,
resembling a real fish, can swim around, actively adsorbing free-floating microplastics.
Source: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/22/scientists-unveil-bionic-robo-fish-to-remove-microplastics-from-seas

However, despite these innovations, the practical application of such technologies on a global scale is
currently limited. The tiny robots adsorb microplastics only in their immediate vicinity, making the process
localized. Even in large numbers, they are unable to cover the vast scale of the ocean. Moreover, they
could become part of the food chain. There are also uncertainties regarding the robots' ability to function
in the harsh ocean conditions, such as currents, pressure, and salinity. Therefore, existing solutions are
not yet effective enough and face serious challenges in scaling up.

Current Methods for Removing Micro- and Nanoplastics
There is growing interest in the potential use of microorganisms, particularly bacteria, for the enzymatic
breakdown of synthetic polymers, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This technology is often
presented as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastic waste disposal methods, such as
incineration. However, the empirical data accumulated so far casts doubt on its effectiveness, safety, and
scalability for industrial use.
In 2016, a team of Japanese scientists led by Shosuke Oda discovered the bacterium called Ideonella
sakaiensis, capable of breaking down PET through the production of two enzymes — PETase and MHETase.
This breakthrough was a significant event in microbiology.312 However, laboratory studies showed that the
degradation process is exceedingly slow: it took the bacteria about seven weeks to break down a 20-gram
plastic film under optimal conditions. Clearly, this rate of degradation cannot be considered satisfactory
for addressing the scale of plastic pollution. On a global scale, where millions of tons of plastic enter the
environment every year, such a slow pace is akin to trying to empty the ocean with a teaspoon.
Scientific efforts have focused on modifying the PETase enzyme that bacteria use to break down plastic.
However, researchers admit that the enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis is still in the early stages of its
evolution. Its efficiency is low, its stability is limited, and accelerating the reaction requires temperatures
not found in natural environments. Even genetic engineering can’t yet predict which mutations will actually
lead to improvement. As Elizabeth Bell from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory put it, progress
is more like “two steps forward, one step back.”
Moreover, enzymatic breakdown is far from universal. Only certain plastics, such as PET, can theoretically
degrade this way. Common plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene remain virtually impervious to
microbial breakdown. Scientists at Nature have asserted: most plastics are too energy-dense to be effectively
broken down by biochemical means.
Even if a highly efficient microbe could be developed, a far more troubling question arises: could it ever
be safely released into the environment? Any genetically modified bacterium poses a potential risk of
causing an environmental catastrophe. Currently, nearly all countries strictly regulate or completely
ban releasing such organisms into the wild.
The reasons are clear: there's no telling how these bacteria might behave after “completing their mission.”
Could they start breaking down other vital organic compounds? Might they outcompete essential microbes?
Could they trigger mutations with even more unpredictable consequences?
In this way, one environmental crisis could easily be replaced by another — one that is far more
unpredictable and destructive.
While fundamental research into bacterial plastic degradation holds undeniable value, at this stage the
technology cannot be considered an effective, scalable, or safe solution to the problem of plastic pollution.

salt content (i.e., hard water) on microplastic removal.
The researchers collected tap water samples of varying hardness levels from the city of Guangzhou.
Three types of plastic particles—polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene — ranging in size from 0.1
to 150 micrometers were added to the samples. The water was boiled for five minutes, then cooled, and
the residual microplastic concentration was measured.
During the boiling process, calcium-rich hard water formed insoluble calcium carbonate (CaCO3),
commonly known as limescale. The researchers hypothesized that microplastic particles could bind to
calcium carbonate crystals and precipitate, which could explain the observed reduction in microplastic
concentrations after boiling.
The highest purification efficiency was observed in samples with high water hardness (300 mg
CaCO3per liter), where boiling removed up to 90% of microplastics. In contrast, in samples with soft water
(less than 60 mg CaCO3 per liter), the effect was significantly weaker, with only about 25% of plastic
particles being removed.
However, despite some positive effects of boiling hard water, an important concern arises: the potential
release of micro- and nanoplastic particles into the air. As water boils, steam is produced, and along with
it, microplastic particles can be aerosolized. Inhalation of these particles poses a far more serious health
risk than ingestion through food or water.
Studies show that upon inhalation, nanoplastics can reach the brain within two hours. In contrast,
when microplastics enter the digestive system, a portion of them is excreted. The accumulation of plastic
particles in the brain is associated with long-term risks, as their removal from brain tissues is virtually
impossible.
Thus, while boiling may reduce microplastic content in drinking water, it potentially increases the risk
of airborne contamination, posing a greater threat to human health. This underscores the urgent need
for safer and more effective methods of water purification.

Pyrolysis as a Method for Plastic Processing:
Efficiency and Risks
Pyrolysis is one of the technologies for plastic waste processing, based on the thermal decomposition
of plastic materials at high temperatures in an environment with limited oxygen availability. The process is
typically conducted at temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 °C and results in the production of gaseous
and liquid hydrocarbon compounds, along with a solid carbon residue.
At elevated temperatures, the polymer chains of plastic materials break down to form a mixture
of hydrocarbons that can be used as fuel. However, this method — along with conventional plastic
incineration — carries significant environmental risks due to the release of nanoplastics.
Under the influence of high temperatures, plastic decomposes into ultra-fine particles, including
nanoplastics (particles smaller than 100 nanometers). These particles are so small that modern filtration
systems are incapable of capturing them completely, allowing their release into the atmosphere.
Plastic combustion is also accompanied by the emission of dioxins and furans—highly toxic compounds
known to have carcinogenic effects.314
Thus, the use of pyrolysis and plastic incineration for fuel production entails considerable risk of
airborne emissions, posing a threat not only to the environment but also to human health. This method
of plastic disposal cannot be considered a safe or sustainable solution to the environmental pollution
crisis. The true cost of such fuel is the threat it poses to human life and well-being.

ALLATRA SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY’S APPROACH
TO COMBATING THE MICRO- AND
NANOPLASTIC EPIDEMIC
Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG) Technologies
for the Ocean Cleanup from MNPs
Restoring ecological balance calls for the widespread adoption of innovative technologies such
as atmospheric water generators (AWGs). Today, these systems are available in a wide range — from
household to industrial models. AWGs are capable of producing drinking water from air, effectively
removing contaminants including microplastics (Fig.124). The water can also be mineralized to enhance
taste and provide additional health benefits.
These generators operate by condensing moisture naturally present in the air.

Figure 124: The image shows a schematic illustration of an atmospheric water generator, with its components
and operating principle

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

141

AWGs function based on two core technologies:
1. Condensation-based technology. This method pulls ambient air into the unit and exposes it to a
chilled surface or cooling coil, causing water vapor to condense into liquid form. The process is similar to
how condensation forms on a cold object taken out of a freezer. Condensation-based AWGs perform best
in warm and humid environments.
2. Adsorption-based technology. This method uses moisture-absorbing materials, such as silica gel,
zeolites, or metal-organic frameworks, to capture humidity from the air. The absorbed water is then released
when the material is heated.
Today, such systems are being used locally to supply drinking water, including in areas affected by
climate-related disasters.
The large-scale deployment of AWGs to meet the needs of both industry and the public could significantly
reduce ocean pollution within a few years. At present, household water sources, including water used for
cooking, often come from reservoirs that contain high concentrations of micro- and nanoplastics. This
contaminated water contributes to the accumulation of plastic in the human body. Shifting to air-derived
water, rather than relying on polluted sources, could substantially improve the quality of drinking water.

Restoration of Ecosystems Using Natural Filtration
and Atmospheric Water Generators
Effectively removing microplastics from used water requires the use of advanced technologies,
including modern filtration and assimilation systems. In addition, wastewater treatment facilities should
be retrofitted to ensure that treated water is not discharged into bodies of water, but instead directed into
soil — where natural microorganisms are capable of breaking down plastic.315
These microorganisms are fundamentally different from genetically modified or artificially engineered
strains developed in laboratories. Their presence in ecosystems is natural, and they do not display the
characteristics of invasive species in these environments.

Research316 shows that certain soil-dwelling microbes native to natural environments317 demonstrate
significant effectiveness in degrading polymers318 such as polyethylene319 and polyethylene terephthalate
(PET).320 For example, the highest rate of fungal degradation — an average mass reduction of polyethylene
by 36.4 ± 5.53% over 16 weeks — was observed in the Aspergillus oryzae A5, 1 strain.
The ability of microbes to biodegrade polymers lies in their production of enzymes that enable them
to break down the complex molecular structures of plastics.317

These findings, confirmed through experimental observations, highlight the potential of natural microbial
communities to reduce environmental contamination from micro- and nanoplastics.
“Among the several remediation techniques available to date, microbial remediation showed better
promise to degrade or sustainably remove MNPs from the environment.” according to a review study
by Indian researchers.318
Thus, transitioning to air-derived water technologies will significantly improve the quality of consumed
water. Combined with microbial remediation techniques, this approach could substantially reduce microand nanoplastic pollution in the environment.

In the upper layers of soil, just as in bodies of water, plastic concentrations will remain high for some
time. However, as water penetrates deeper underground, a natural self-purification process occurs
(Fig. 127). Soil-dwelling microorganisms help break down tiny nanoplastic particles.

Figure 127: The image schematically illustrates the process of biological purification of wastewater discharged
into the soil through geological layers. Arrows indicate the path of the wastewater as it passes through layers of
soil and rock, where microorganisms and filtering materials remove contaminants. The soil layers are marked in
different colors: brown for topsoil, gray for sand and gravel.

Increasing the volume of treated and filtered wastewater directed into the soil promotes the growth
of microorganisms — bacteria, fungi, and archaea — that play a foundational role in building healthy soil,
nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem resilience. Over time, this purified water will percolate into deeper
layers and eventually return to the oceans.
Installing atmospheric water generators in arid regions, along with the return of used water to the
soil, presents a promising strategy for addressing the global water crisis and combating desertification.
These efforts activate processes that support the restoration of vegetation and ecosystems.321 The use
of AWGs will also improve quality of life in local communities by helping to solve the issue of drinking
water scarcity.

When combined with microbial remediation, the use of AWGs can be a major step toward sustainable
water management and the recovery of degraded land.
A full transition to AWG technology would involve using atmospheric water for all human needs —
domestic, industrial, and agricultural. Global-scale adoption of this approach would increase evaporation
rates, resulting in ocean cooling and accelerated ocean cleansing. Additionally, by reducing excess
atmospheric moisture, AWGs could lessen the intensity of extreme precipitation and wind events,
potentially mitigating the destructive impact of natural disasters (see more in the film Water from Air:
Humanity’s Path to Survival for more).
Challenges and Risks Associated with the Use of Atmospheric Water Generators
However, there is a downside to the widespread deployment of AWGs. The core concern lies in the
insufficient assessment of AWG’s direct impact on human health. While the technology can indeed
contribute to the purification of oceanic waters and improve thermal conductivity in the climate system,
large-scale use of AWGs may also lead to a significant increase in atmospheric microplastic concentrations.
The operational mechanism of AWG involves the condensation of moisture from the atmosphere,
which is then replenished through evaporation from ocean waters. Since these waters contain high
concentrations of microplastics and nanoplastics, the vapor entering the atmosphere during this process
may carry ultrafine plastic particles. As a result, in regions where AWG systems are deployed—including
major metropolitan areas—the concentration of airborne nanoplastics people breathe may rise to levels
currently observed in coastal zones. This presents a serious risk: increased atmospheric nanoplastic
concentrations pose a threat to human health. Inhaled nanoplastics can accumulate in the human body,
including in the brain.
And this is the critical point. It is essential to understand that the original idea of using AWGs as a tool
to help purify ocean water was proposed by ALLATRA scientists over twenty years ago, at a time when
atmospheric microplastic concentrations were still extremely low. Back then, the implementation of
such technologies could have indeed delivered tangible environmental benefits without posing serious
risks to human health.
However, the situation has changed drastically. Under current conditions, large-scale deployment of
AWGs is more likely to increase airborne MNP concentrations. With current atmospheric MNP levels
already high, introducing additional volumes through AWGs could prove fatal for human health.
Thus, a technology that was once seen as promising and innovative has now lost its relevance. As a
global society, we missed a critically important window during which AWGs could have served as a viable
solution. In the context of climate issues and environmental pollution, the factor of time plays a decisive
role. What might have preserved the health of millions and truly contributed to cleaning the planet two
decades ago now poses a potentially serious danger.
AWG is no longer a technology of the future—it is a reminder of a missed opportunity. In the current
circumstances, the priority must shift to developing methods for removing MNPs from both the atmosphere
and the human body. Above all, we need to buy ourselves time.

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Innovative Scientific Approach to Reducing the Toxicity
of Micro- and Nanoplastics
Given the presented data on the multi-level and cumulative impact of microplastics, and especially
nanoplastics, on human health, it becomes evident that modern civilization is facing an ecological and
biomedical challenge that transcends traditional notions of environmental pollution. This issue not only
affects individual biospheres, but also the long-term sustainability of the Homo sapiens population.
To date, nearly all the plastic ever produced — over 9 billion tons — continues to accumulate in the
environment, undergoing fragmentation into micro and nano-sized particles, which exhibit high chemical
and biological activity. Micro- and nanoplastics have been found in soil, water, air, and across all major
food categories, ranging from vegetables and fruits to meat, fish, honey, milk, and salt. This indicates the
widespread infiltration of plastic particles into the food chain, significantly transforming the traditional
understanding of “safe” or “healthy” food.
The route of particles penetration into the human body largely determines their biological behavior and
distribution. While plastic entering through the digestive tract may be partially excreted, the inhalation route
poses a significantly higher degree of risk. Inhaled nanoplastics settle in lung tissue, cross the blood-brain
barrier, and may directly reach the brain, where they can accumulate over time. Natural detoxification
mechanisms (such as the liver and kidneys) do not have effective means of recognizing and removing
these particles.
The highest concentration of microplastics is found near water bodies, coastal zones, and forest
areas, especially in conditions of high humidity and temperature. In such landscapes, plastic lingers
longer, participates in aerosol transport, induces oxidative stress in plants, and reduces the efficiency of
photosynthetic processes. Coastal recreation, once considered a health-promoting activity, now carries an
additional inhalation burden: according to estimates, the volume of inhaled plastic near open water bodies
can be many times higher than the indicators of the urban environment.
Epidemiological studies show a consistent correlation between the levels of micro- and nanoplastic (MNP)
pollution and the prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, diabetes,
stroke, as well as depressive and cognitive disorders. Due to their ability to cross biological barriers and
accumulate in various tissues, including the brain, heart, lungs, and placenta, MNPs exert toxic effects at
the molecular, cellular, and organ levels. As plastics build up in the body, they produce immunosuppressive,
inflammatory, and genotoxic effects. Despite progress in identifying these risks, effective mechanisms for
neutralizing and removing MNPs from the human body have not yet been developed.

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

147

One of the most critical properties of nanoplastics with systemic biological implications is their ability to
retain an electrostatic charge. Unlike inert particles, nanoplastics actively interact with cell surfaces, proteins,
receptors, and even genetic material, forming stable molecular-level bonds. This property not only enhances
the penetration of nanoplastics through biological barriers, including the blood-brain barrier, but also hinders
their elimination, leading to prolonged retention in tissues, particularly in the brain. Electrostatic interactions
trigger a cascade of cellular disruptions, including membrane depolarization, mitochondrial dysfunction,
oxidative stress, and apoptosis, which significantly increases toxicity even at minimal concentrations of
nanoplastic particles.

The authors of this report propose that the solution to neutralizing or shielding the
electrostatic charge of micro- and nanoplastics could represent a fundamental breakthrough
that could significantly reduce the biological activity of nanoplastics and slow the rate at which they
accumulate in critical organs. According to the authors’ estimates, electrostatic charge shielding
or neutralization could reduce the potential danger of micro- and nanoplastics by at least 50%,
making this research area critically important. This could provide the scientific community with the
necessary window of time to develop more comprehensive approaches to diagnosing, detoxifying,
and preventing the MNP-related effects. In this regard, research in biophysics, nanomaterials science,
and molecular toxicology will be of paramount importance. Delays in addressing this issue could
accelerate degradation processes.
Simultaneously with biomedical solutions, a scientifically backed strategy for the safe handling
of plastic waste is urgently needed. The current waste disposal systems are unable to prevent
further fragmentation of plastics and their entry into the biosphere. In the context of globalization,
it is essential to develop an international technological platform for the creation, implementation,
and scaling of safe plastic collection and recycling methods. Such measures can only be achieved
through institutional support, cross-border regulations, and scientific diplomacy.
Raising awareness within the scientific community, healthcare professionals, and the general
public has become particularly crucial. To date, most people are unaware of the full extent of the
micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) impact and continue to unknowingly contribute to their spread.
Thus, the issue of micro- and nanoplastics has ceased to be a potential threat and has transformed
into a systemic risk factor. Now this area requires prioritized attention from the scientific community
and healthcare authorities, data systematization, the development of risk assessment standards, and
strengthening the intergovernmental and international cooperation. To develop effective solutions
that safeguard biological security both in the short and long term, an interdisciplinary approach,
institutional recognition, and international coordination of efforts are essential.

THE X FACTOR:
ROLE OF MICRO- AND NANOPLASTICS
IN THE DYNAMICS OF NATURAL DISASTERS
As noted in the chapter “Impact of Micro- and Nanoplastics on the Climate,” micro- and nanoplastic
particles reduce the thermal conductivity of ocean water, leading to heat accumulation and, as a result, a
critical rise in ocean temperatures. However, micro- and nanoplastics are not themselves a direct source
of ocean warming.
Since the spring of 2023, and continuing for over a year, the average surface temperature of the World
Ocean has been breaking historical records on a daily basis, marking an unprecedented event in the history
of observations (Fig. 128). Scientists around the world are deeply concerned about this abnormal rise.
Dr. Brian McNoldy, senior researcher at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
Science at the University of Miami, notes: “It’s not just an entire year of record-breaking
ocean temperatures, but it’s the margin it’s breaking them by — it’s not even close to
what the previous record was.”322

Dr. Rob Larter, a British marine geophysicist, echoes these concerns: “It’s quite scary,
partly because I’m not hearing any scientists that have a convincing explanation of why
it is we’ve got such a departure”...“But the impression at the moment is that things have
gone further and faster than we expected.”323

Climate research data shows that current models predict a gradual increase in ocean surface
temperatures, yet the observed rate of warming is significantly outpacing all projections. While scientists
confirm anthropogenic climate change is a contributing factor, it alone cannot fully account for this
unprecedented phenomenon.

Professor John Abraham from the University of St. Thomas, a specialist in ocean temperature
studies, has proposed the existence of previously unknown factors influencing long-term ocean surface
temperature changes.322 He emphasized these elements were not accounted for in existing climate
models. The authors of this report hypothesize about a potential "X Factor" that may be driving additional
warming in both oceanic and atmospheric systems.

Could Micro- and Nanoplastics
in the Ocean Be an Unidentified X Factor?
An analysis of the possibility that micro- and nanoplastics are the main driver behind current ocean
warming reveals a critical contradiction. While nanoplastics do impair the ocean’s ability to release heat,
they do not generate thermal energy themselves—they merely hinder its escape.
Over the past 60 years, the deep ocean has been warming 15 times faster than it did over the previous
10,000 years,324, 325 and this trend is accelerating every year. The rate of progression is becoming
increasingly rapid. However, it requires an enormous amount of energy to raise the temperature at
depths where sunlight no longer penetrates.326, 327
The large-scale influx of micro- and nanoplastics into the ocean began relatively recently—approximately
30 years ago. However, the accelerated warming of the ocean’s deeper layers has been observed for
over 60 years. This timeline reveals a key inconsistency: plastic pollution alone cannot account for the
long-term, steadily increasing trend of deep ocean warming, which began well before these contaminants
became widespread.
Solar radiation doesn’t provide a sufficient explanation either. Sunlight penetrates the ocean only to a
depth of about 200 meters. The water can be heated by the Sun to a maximum depth of about 700 meters
as a result of mixing.328 However, warming the much deeper layers —beyond the reach of sunlight—would
require a vast and sustained energy source.
This suggests that the heat accumulating in the ocean must be coming from another source. Meanwhile,
the presence of nanoplastics appears to trap this heat, preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere.
Since solar heating cannot explain the exponential rise in ocean temperatures, scientists have proposed
that there may be additional, as yet unidentified, sources of heat operating in various regions of the ocean.

Vertical Distribution of Temperature Anomalies
The analysis of global temperature fluctuations at various ocean depths, based on data from the
Argo system over the past two decades, has revealed a series of anomalies that do not align with the
conventional model of downward heat transfer from the surface to deeper ocean layers.329, 330
Statistically significant cases of temperature gradient inversion have been documented, in which warmer
water masses are found beneath relatively cooler surface layers (Fig. 129). This type of temperature
stratification is physically impossible under a strictly top-down heat transfer model, as thermal energy,
according to the laws of physics, cannot pass through a colder intermediate layer from above.

Recent studies by scientists from the Ocean University of China331 confirm the presence of thermal
anomalies within ocean water columns that do not appear on the surface. The research has shown that
one-third of marine heatwaves leave no trace on the ocean surface, while nearly half are only partially
visible throughout their life cycle.
The annual number of these subsurface marine heatwaves has increased significantly over the past
three decades due to ongoing ocean warming. The fact that a substantial portion of marine heatwaves
is completely undetectable at the surface clearly indicates that they cannot be caused by atmospheric
heat alone.

Study of Heat Sources at the Ocean Floor
Research and continuous monitoring of temperatures on the ocean floor remain extremely rare
and limited to this day. For a long time, science has not prioritized tracking changes at such extreme
depths. Modern monitoring systems, such as the ARGO buoy network, currently collect data from only
about 0.03% of the ocean’s surface area, with most buoys descending to just half the average ocean
depth—falling short of reaching the seabed.332
To date, humanity has explored only about 3–3.5% of the ocean floor.333 This is due to several significant
challenges. First of all, the majority of the World Ocean lies at depths of 3,000 to 6,000 meters. The
development of deep-sea vehicles capable of withstanding the immense pressure at depths of up to
6,000 meters requires substantial financial and technological resources.
Second, the expeditions themselves are extremely complex and expensive; throughout history, only
eight specialized vehicles have ever been constructed for this purpose. For this reason, in some respects,
we have studied outer space more thoroughly than the most remote regions of the World Ocean.
At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that geological processes on the ocean floor may
play a significant role in climate change and in shaping the ocean’s heat balance. The seafloor is home
to millions of unique geological features — volcanoes, fault lines, and hydrothermal vents — that release
tremendous amounts of energy. However, due to their inaccessibility and limited monitoring coverage,
the full extent of their potential impact remains largely unknown to science.
Nevertheless, research on the ocean floor continues, and a number of studies have already pointed
to localized heating of ocean water originating from the seafloor.
For example, in two deep sections of the Argentine Basin,334 at depths greater than 4,500 meters,
significant warming trends have been observed: 0.02 °C ± 0.01 °C per decade during the period from
2009 to 2019. That's a tremendous amount of energy required to heat such a vast volume of cold water
on the ocean floor.
Right off the coast of West Antarctica, anomalous warming of the deep waters of the Weddell Sea335
is taking place While the upper 700 meters of water show little to no warming, a consistent temperature
increase is observed in deeper regions. On one side, the Weddell Sea is bordered by the West Antarctic

The Role of Geothermal Heat Flux,
Tectonic Activity, and Seafloor Volcanism
In the context of observed deep-water warming anomalies—where atmospheric influence is minimal—it
seems logical to consider geothermal heat flow from Earth's interior as a potential source of additional
heat. Traditionally, climate models treat geothermal heat flux from below as constant, at approximately
0.09 W/m² (or 90 mW/m²),336 which is several orders of magnitude lower than solar radiation.337, 338
However, an increasing body of scientific evidence points to the significance of this underestimated
source of heat. Large-scale geothermal studies have shown that the amount of heat flux emerging from
the ocean floor depends on the age of the oceanic crust: it is highest in young seafloor spreading zones
and lowest in older ocean basins (Fig. 130).339
These localized anomalies can influence the vertical temperature structure of the water, weaken the
thermocline, and promote mixing of water masses, which in turn affects circulation, biological productivity,
and even the stability of glaciers in polar regions.

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Geothermal Heat Flux — the quantity of thermal heat being released from Earth's interior
through a unit area of the surface in a unit of time, measured in milliwatts per square
meter (mW/m²).

While the average geothermal heat flux is about 40–60 mW/m² for continental areas and approximately
100 mW/m² for the ocean floor, certain regions exhibit values several times higher. The highest heat flux
levels are recorded in tectonically and volcanically active zones—such as mid-ocean ridges and active
rift zones—where the flux can exceed 200 to 1,000 mW/m².340
Exceptionally high heat flux is observed in hydrothermal vent fields—areas where hot fluids discharge
directly onto the seafloor, with water temperatures reaching 350–400 °C. These systems create unique
ecosystems and generate localized heat flow anomalies that significantly impact the thermal conditions
of bottom waters.
The most thoroughly studied areas of elevated geothermal heat flux on the ocean floor are the mid-ocean
ridges—zones where tectonic plates are spreading apart and new oceanic crust is actively forming. This
global system of underwater ridges stretches for approximately 60,000 kilometers,341 encircling the planet
like the seams of a baseball. Mid-ocean ridges are characterized by a high concentration of hydrothermal
vents, submarine volcanoes, and active fault lines that allow substantial amounts of heat energy from
Earth’s mantle to enter the ocean.342
In these regions, geothermal heat flux is 10 to 100 times higher than the average for the rest of the
seafloor,326 making mid-ocean ridges critical zones for heat exchange between Earth's interior and the
World Ocean.
Professor Arthur Viterito of the University of Maryland has documented a rise in earthquake activity
along mid-ocean ridges since 1995 (Fig. 131).343 With a correlation coefficient of 0.7, this increase aligns
with the global temperature rise, with temperature increases lagging approximately two years behind the
uptick in seismic activity. This surge in seismicity is associated with the upward movement of magma,
which creates new oceanic crust.

Although there are no direct measurements of the volume of rising magma, the global seismic
monitoring network allows scientists to estimate the scale of these processes indirectly by analyzing the
number and intensity of seismic events, which have been increasing regardless of the amount of seismic
data. According to Viterito’s hypothesis, seismic and volcanic activity along the mid-ocean ridges leads
to an increase in hydrothermal venting and ocean water heating, which in turn contributes to greenhouse
gas emissions and atmospheric warming. In this way, Viterito demonstrates that oceans are warming
not only from above, but also from below, as a result of geological processes.
Submarine volcanism may also play a major role in shaping the thermal regime of the ocean floor.
Current data indicate that about 75% of all volcanic eruptions on Earth occur underwater.344 It was
previously believed that underwater eruptions occurred through the gentle outflow of lava, and that
explosive eruptions were impossible due to the pressure of the water column. As a result, it was assumed
that submarine volcanoes could not heat the water column, since the emerging lava would solidify almost
immediately. However, recent research has changed our understanding of the eruption mechanisms of
underwater volcanoes. Magma pressure ranges from 10,000 to 30,000 bar, while the pressure of the
water column in the deepest parts of the ocean is only about 1,000 bar.When magma erupts,, it causes
instantaneous boiling of water and the breakdown of H2O molecules, forming a gas-water cavity with
pressures reaching hundreds or even thousands of bar.345 This results in powerful explosive eruptions.

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

These eruptions are accompanied by the release of tephra and hydrotherms — giant jets of superheated
water, with volumes that can reach the equivalent of 40 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Such
emissions can disrupt the ocean’s thermal balance not only locally, but on a global scale.
Research conducted by the University of Leeds has revealed kilometer-scale fields of volcanic tephra
on the Pacific Ocean floor,346 providing strong evidence of powerful explosive submarine eruptions. A
single eruption of this kind can release thermal energy on the order of 1 terawatt — twice the annual
energy consumption of the United States.

The contribution of explosive eruptions to ocean heating is further supported by
Professor Bernd Zimanowski of Julius-Maximilians University in Bavaria, who explains:347
“With submarine lava eruptions, it takes a quite long time for the heat of the lava to
be transferred to the water. In explosive eruptions, however, the magma is broken up
into tiny particles. This may create heat pulses so strong that the thermal equilibrium
currents in the oceans are disrupted locally or even globally.”348

Current estimates suggest that the number of hydrothermally active submarine formations ranges
from 100,000 to as many as 10 million349, 350— an indication that the contribution of hydrothermal activity
to the ocean’s heat balance may be significantly underestimated. Explosive magma eruptions generate
powerful thermal impulses capable of disrupting oceanic heat currents on a local scale. However, given
the vast size of the ocean, even such intense underwater eruptions are not sufficient to heat it globally.
Volcanoes are not uniformly distributed, their eruptions are episodic, and the total energy released is
not enough to warm the entire ocean. Still, it may be sufficient to trigger localized heat waves in certain
regions.
A specific example of such localized thermal anomalies is the phenomenon known as marine
heatwaves — areas of ocean water that remain abnormally warm for extended periods. Another term
for these events is blobs: massive patches of surface water with significantly elevated temperatures.
Since 1995, the number of blobs has increased sharply,351 and they are appearing more frequently in
various parts of the world’s oceans, including off the coasts of New Zealand, southwestern Africa, and
the southern Indian Ocean.

One of the most well-known and extensive blobs formed in the Gulf of Alaska in 2013 and quickly
spread across the Pacific Ocean. It covered an area of more than 4,000,000 square kilometers — larger
than the entire country of India, and in some areas, sea surface temperatures exceeded the average by
5–6 degrees Celsius (Fig. 132). The blob drifted through the ocean from Alaska to Mexico over the course
of three years, lasting until 2016. This phenomenon had a significant negative impact on the region’s
marine ecosystem and climate.
The most likely cause of the blob’s formation was intense volcanic activity off the coast of Alaska
and the presence of the Cobb magma plume,352 which heated deep ocean waters that later rose to the
surface in massive volumes.

In December 2019, a heat blob emerged in the southern Pacific Ocean, east of New Zealand, with
temperatures on certain days reaching 6 °C above average. The blob covered an area of more than one
million square kilometers—equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Texas or four times the size of New Zealand
(Fig. 132). At the time, it was reported to be the largest heat blob in the world’s oceans. Moreover, it was
the second-largest such event ever recorded in this region.

the temperatures there are about 15°C, at the moment they are about 20°C.”353

Another notable example of how geothermal heat from magmatic processes contributes to ocean
warming is the anomalous heating of Arctic seas along the Siberian coast. According to 2022 research,
the Siberian Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average — a rate significantly higher
than previously accounted for in climate models, which came as a major surprise to scientists (Fig. 134).355

In this specific region of the world—near the Taymyr Peninsula—we are witnessing the activation of the
Siberian magmatic plume, which is now rapidly rising in the same area where the Siberian Traps erupted
250 million years ago. Current evidence suggests that the plume head is actively eroding the East Siberian
Craton, with magma spreading beneath its entire expanse (Fig. 135). Preliminary estimates suggest that
the area of magma dispersal beneath Siberia may span 2,500 to 3,000 kilometers in diameter—an area
comparable to the size of Australia.

It is important to note that such intense warming of the Arctic seas is occurring specifically in the
region in the vicinity of the Taymyr Peninsula. This anomaly, particularly in the oceanic zone of Siberia,
can be explained by the thinner oceanic crust which conducts heat more efficiently, and the higher heat
capacity of water compared to the atmosphere. Ocean water, therefore, intensively absorbs and retains
heat from the ascending magma plume, even though the plume is rising beneath the continental crust
at a relative distance from the coastline.

plume, its impact on the climate system, associated

The combined body of evidence strongly indicates that geological processes on the ocean floor are a
significant factor in global warming. The rise in seismic and volcanic activity on the seafloor correlates
with increasing global temperatures, suggesting a possible cause-and-effect relationship. Submarine
eruptions—particularly those of an explosive nature—are capable of generating powerful thermal pulses
that disrupt both local and even global heat balance. Hydrothermal systems and volcanic activity produce
large-scale anomalies such as “blobs,” which have a marked impact on marine ecosystems and climate,
while magmatic processes are responsible for abnormal warming of the Arctic seas.
Thus, the ocean is warming not only from the top, under the influence of the atmosphere, but also
from below, due to dynamic processes in the Earth's interior. This requires a reevaluation of existing
climate models and a deeper study of underwater geological activity as an important component of the
overall heat balance of the planet.
However, there is one question that is of key importance: Why is there an increase in magmatic and
tectonic activity on Earth at this time?

Brief Description of the Geodynamic Model of Climate Change
on Earth in the Current Period
Over the past 30 years, Earth has experienced an unprecedented and synchronized escalation not only
in climate change but also in anomalies across all layers of the planet and its geophysical parameters.
These changes are increasing exponentially. A comprehensive analysis of scientific data indicates that
the primary cause lies in astronomical cycles that recur every 12,000 years.
The hypothesis of cosmic influence is supported by similar changes that have been occurring
simultaneously on other planets and moons in the Solar System. For example, wind speeds are increasing
and hurricane zones are expanding on Uranus,356 Jupiter,357 and Venus.358 Mars is experiencing polar ice
cap melting,359 while volcanic activity is increasing on both Venus360 and Mars.361 Additionally, seismic
activity is intensifying362 on Mars—a geologically "dead" planet—suggesting abnormal internal processes.
Critical shifts in Earth’s geosystem began to emerge around 1995, marked by significant geophysical
anomalies such as a sharp acceleration in the planet’s rotation, a shift in Earth's axis, and the onset of
rapid drift of the North Magnetic Pole (Fig. 136).

Figure 136: Changes in Earth's geophysical parameters in 1995

These anomalies indicate profound changes in the Earth's core, requiring quadrillions of times more
energy than humanity has produced throughout the entire history of civilization. The cause is external
cosmic influence affecting the Earth's core, as well as the cores of other planets in the Solar System.
This external force amplifies mantle melting, causing it to rise closer to the surface. As a result, a chain
reaction is triggered: volcanic and seismic activity intensifies, heating from the Earth's interior increases,
and natural catastrophes grow in frequency worldwide.
Since 1995, there has been a noticeable increase in seismic activity, characterized by higher frequency,
magnitude, and energy of earthquakes. This trend is visible both on land and in oceans, including regions
where seismic activity was previously almost nonexistent. All of this points to the global scale of these
changes. It is important to note that the rise in earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.0 or higher is not related
to an increase in sensor networks or sensitivity, but genuinely reflects changes in Earth's geodynamics.
According to data from the International Seismological Centre, the number of such earthquakes over
the past 25 years has substantially increased and continues to rise (Fig. 137).
Furthermore, seismic activity is growing near volcanoes, including supervolcanoes such as Yellowstone
in the USA, the Phlegraean Fields in Italy,363 and Taupō in New Zealand364—as well as other volcanoes
that erupted during previous 12,000-year cycles (Fig. 137).

An increasing number of days each year are marked by volcanic eruptions, with ejected lava often
exhibiting anomalous properties such as overheating and a unique chemical composition characteristic
of magma originating from the planet’s deeper mantle layers.
A particularly concerning development is the growing frequency of deep-focus earthquakes, which
occur at depths exceeding 300 kilometers—sometimes extending as deep as 750 kilometers beneath the
Earth's surface. Unlike typical earthquakes that occur in the Earth’s crust, these phenomena originate in
the mantle, where the material is usually ductile, deforming like plastic rather than fracturing. This makes
the nature of these earthquakes highly unusual.

164

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

Given that these deep-focus earthquakes occur under extreme pressure and temperature conditions,
they are likely the result of powerful mantle explosions. Their energy is comparable to the simultaneous
detonation of multiple nuclear bombs within Earth's mantle. Additionally, deep-focus earthquakes are
often capable of triggering strong seismic events in the Earth’s crust, amplifying their destructive impacts.
Since 1995, there has been a sharp increase in the number of such deep earthquakes (Fig. 138),
coinciding with other geodynamic anomalies that began during the same period. The surge in the
frequency of these intra-mantle explosions signals heightened energy activity within the Earth’s interior
and accelerated mantle melting, which could potentially lead to large-scale volcanic eruptions.

Since 1995, under the influence of centrifugal forces, molten magma within Earth's mantle has begun
rising more actively toward the surface, eroding and heating the lithosphere from within more intensely
than usual. This upward movement of magma increases the geothermal heat flux from Earth’s interior
and activates magma plumes beneath the glaciers of West Antarctica, Central Greenland, and Siberia.
As a result, glaciers and permafrost are melting from the bottom up at an accelerated pace.365, 366, 367
Thus, one of the key causes of ocean warming is rising magma, which particularly affects the oceanic
crust—thinner and more vulnerable than continental crust—by heating it from below.
Historical records from geological strata and ice cores indicate that Earth has undergone similar
catastrophic cycles approximately every 12,000 years. Moreover, every second cycle—roughly every
24,000 years—these planetary disasters have been even more intense (Fig. 139).

Earth is currently entering one of these cycles. However, this time, due to anthropogenic pollution of
the ocean with micro- and nanoplastics, the thermal imbalance within the mantle has intensified. This
has led to an increase in the number of deep-focus earthquakes, the formation of new magma chambers,
and a general destabilization of the planet. As a result, cataclysms are accelerating far more rapidly and
severely than in previous cycles.
In fact, ocean pollution has become a primary reason why Earth may not withstand this cycle. It is
important to understand that addressing ocean contamination by micro- and nanoplastics can slow the
progression of these cataclysms—but it will not stop them.

More detailed information about the current
geodynamic activation of Earth's interior, the
12,000-year cycle of cataclysms, and possible
solutions to this issue can be found in the report
“ON THE PROGRESSION OF CLIMATE
CATACLYSMS ON EARTH AND THEIR
CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES.”

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

As shown by years of interdisciplinary research into geodynamic changes during the 12,000-year
cycle, the primary cause of ocean heating is rising magma, which has a particularly strong impact on
the oceanic crust due to its thinner and more vulnerable structure compared to the continental crust.
Pollution of the World Ocean with plastic and the accumulation of micro- and nanoplastic particles has
become a critical factor altering the thermophysical properties of the ocean. The presence of these
synthetic particles in ocean water significantly reduces its ability to conduct heat, disrupting natural heat
exchange processes between the deep ocean layers and the surface. Even more critically, it interferes
with heat dissipation from the lithospheric plates. Under conditions of increased geodynamic activity
during the 12,000-year cycle, this critical disruption of the ocean water’s heat conductivity function not
only intensifies the heating of the ocean and atmosphere, but also increases subsurface heating. As a
result, mantle melting accelerates, further amplifying geodynamic activity.
This leads to the accumulation of excess energy in the Earth’s interior, resulting in an increase in
deep-focus earthquakes and the accelerated formation of new magma chambers. In turn, these processes
further exacerbate planetary instability and accelerate ocean heating.
A dangerous feedback loop begins to form: geodynamic activity heats the ocean — the heat accelerates
plastic degradation — rising concentrations of microplastics reduce the thermal conductivity of seawater
— this disrupts heat dissipation from the Earth’s interior — which further intensifies geodynamic activity
and increases earthquake frequency — leading to even more ocean heating, which in turn speeds up the
breakdown of plastic into micro- and nanoparticles.

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

167

This contributes to the rising frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and natural disasters—
such as floods, hurricanes, and tropical cyclones—which are now occurring more intensely than ever
before.
Thus, micro- and nanoplastic pollution of the ocean exerts not only a destructive effect on human
health, ecosystems, the biosphere, and the climate system by intensifying ocean warming—it also acts
as an amplifying factor in the already extreme catastrophes associated with the 24,000-year cycle that
the Earth has now entered. This creates unprecedented risks not only for the survival of humanity but
for the planet itself.
Addressing the global environmental, climatic, and geodynamic crisis requires international collaboration
among scientists from multiple disciplines to urgently develop and implement comprehensive solutions.
These must include ocean decontamination from micro- and nanoplastics, mitigation of their harmful
effects on the human body, and fundamental responses to geodynamic threats.
Proposed solutions can be found in the relevant reports:

NANOPLASTICS IN THE BIOSPHERE
FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

CONCLUSIONS: NANOPLASTICS
ARE A CHALLENGE THAT MUSTN’T BE IGNORED

The problem of plastic pollution, particularly with micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), has moved beyond
the scope of localized environmental damage and has evolved into a complex global threat. Recent research
confirms both the direct and indirect impact of MNPs on the climate system, ecosystem resilience, and
human health. Microplastic particles are capable of penetrating living organisms, triggering inflammatory
responses, disrupting hormonal balance, impairing immune and reproductive functions, and altering the
physical and chemical properties of the environment, from ocean water to the atmosphere.
More than a decade ago, representatives of the ALLATRA international scientific community put forward
the hypothesis that plastic pollution would exert an increasingly significant influence on climate anomalies
and exacerbate public health challenges. Today, these hypotheses are being confirmed by independent
studies conducted by leading scientific institutions. The rapid accumulation of data on the environmental
and biological effects of MNPs is opening new avenues of analysis, including the transformation of climate
patterns, changes in the hydrosphere, and the escalation of systemic risks to sustainable development.
Of particular concern is the discovery that even microscopic concentrations of nanoplastics can initiate
cascading effects throughout the biosphere and climate system. Plastic is no longer just solid waste: it
has become an active agent of transformation, impacting both the environment and the human body. Its
consequences are already becoming apparent. The MNP crisis extends beyond ecology and medicine; it
must also be understood in the context of national security, macroeconomics, and international relations.
As part of its strategy to counter this threat, the ALLATRA Movement has proposed two key directions,
both with practical applications and predictive potential. The first involves the large-scale implementation of
atmospheric water generation (AWG) technologies, which can simultaneously address freshwater scarcity
and contribute to the removal of microplastic particles from the atmosphere and oceans. However, the
deployment of AWG technologies must also take into account potential risks: specifically, the increased
concentration of MNPs in the air and the resulting intensification of inhalation exposure in humans. This
underscores the urgent need for the parallel development of highly effective filtration and protective systems.
The second strategic direction proposed by ALLATRA involves the development of methods to neutralize
or shield the electrostatic charge of nanoplastics — one of the primary factors contributing to their toxicity.
Charged nanoplastic particles actively interact with cell membranes, proteins, and genetic material, forming
stable molecular bonds. These particles can penetrate biological barriers, including the blood-brain barrier,
accumulating in tissues, and trigger a cascade of cellular disruptions — from oxidative stress to apoptosis.
Reducing the electrostatic activity of micro- and nanoplastics could significantly decrease their harmful
effects and slow their accumulation in the human body.

FROM MOLECULAR IMPACT TO PLANETARY CRISIS

According to the authors of the report, shielding or neutralizing the electrostatic charge of MNPs
can reduce their potential hazard by at least 50%, making this area of research critically important.
Such measures would provide a necessary window of time to develop more comprehensive strategies
for diagnosing, preventing, and removing MNPs from the human body, as well as for cleaning up the
biosphere. In this context, research in the fields of biophysics, nanotechnology, and molecular toxicology
becomes especially significant.
Thus, an effective response to the threat posed by MNPs requires not isolated measures, but a global
and interdisciplinary approach. Coordinated efforts are needed across scientific research, technological
innovation, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation. Plastic pollution must not be viewed
as a narrow environmental issue, but rather as a systemic challenge that affects public health, safety,
resource security, and the resilience of social infrastructure.
What makes this report unique is its comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach, integrating data from
physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. This synthesis allows the issue of MNPs to be viewed as a
civilizational challenge requiring solutions at multiple levels. The global community is only beginning to
grasp the true scale of this threat. While no universal solution currently exists, it is the pursuit of such
a solution and the advancement of scientific collaboration that may pave the way toward overcoming
the crisis. The primary challenge is not the absence of a solution, but the ability to identify one before
reaching a critical tipping point.
